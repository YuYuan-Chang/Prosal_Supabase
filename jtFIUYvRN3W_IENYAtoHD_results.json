Old part cannot replace new.\rCode 6:  Part redesigned - Parts not interchangeable.\r3.4   Mercury Free - The material supplied under this contract/purchase order is intended for use on submarines/surface ships and therefore shall contain no metallic mercury and shall be free from mercury contamination.  Mercury contamination of the material\rwill be cause for rejection.\r       If the inclusion of metallic mercury is required as a functional part of the material furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the Procurement Contracting Officer before proceeding with manufacture.  The\rcontractor's request shall explain in detail the requirements for mercury, identify specifically the parts to contain mercury, and explain the method of protection against mercury escape.  Such a request will be forwarded directly to the Procurement Contracting\rOfficer with a copy to the applicable Government Inspector. Upon approval by the Contracting Officer, the vendor will provide a \"Warning Plate\" stating that metallic mercury is a functional part of the item and will include name and location of that part.\r       The use of mercury, mercury compounds, or mercury-bearing instruments and/or equipment in a manner which might cause contamination in the manufacture, assembly, or test of material on this contract is prohibited.  The most probable causes of\rcontamination are direct-connected manometers, mercury vacuum pumps, mercury seals, or the handling of mercury in the immediate vicinity.  Mercury switches, mercury in glass thermometers, standard cells and other items containing mercury may be used if they are\rlocated so as not to constitute a contamination hazard.\r       If external contamination by metallic mercury occurs or is suspected, the following test may be used to determine whether contamination by metallic mercury exists or whether corrective cleaning measures have been effective.  Enclose the equipment in a\rpolyethylene bag or close-fitting airtight container for eight hours at room temperature (70 degrees F minimum).Sample the trapped air and if mercury vapor concentration is 0.01 mg/cu meter or more, the material is mercury contaminated insofar as the\rrequirements of this contract are concerned.\r       These requirements shall be included in any subcontract or purchase order hereunder and the Contractor shall insure SubContractor compliance with these requirements.\r       Technical questions pertaining to these requirements shall be referred to the Procurement Contracting Officer via the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer.  For background, the following information is provided:\r       Mercury is corrosive to gold, silver, nickel, stainless steels, aluminum and copper alloys.  Stainless steels, nickel, and copper alloys are widely used in reactor plants and other submarine/surface ship systems.  Accidental trapping of mercury in a\rcomponent could cause serious damage to vital parts.  Mercury is also toxic if inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin.  It is evident that grave consequences could result from small amounts of mercury vapor present in an unreplenished submarine/surface\rship atmosphere.\r3.5   Security Clearance Required - This contract/purchase order requires the Contractor to have a Government Security Clearance in accordance with the attached Contract Security Classification Specification (DD Form 254).\r4.  QUALITY ASSURANCE\r4.1   Responsibility for Inspection - Unless otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order, the Contractor is responsible for the performance of all inspection requirements as specified herein.  Except as otherwise specified in the contract/purchase order,\rthe Contractor may use his own or any other facilities suitable for the performance of the inspection requirements specified herein, unless disapproved by the Government.  The Government reserves the right to perform any of the inspections set forth in the\rspecification where such inspections are deemed necessary to assure supplies and services conform to prescribed requirements.\r4.2   Responsibility for Compliance - All items must meet all requirements of this contract/purchase order.

The absence of any\rinspection requirements shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility of assuring that all products or supplies submitted to the Government for acceptance comply with all requirements of the contract/purchase order.  Sampling in quality conformance\rdoes not authorize submission of known defective material, either indicated or actual, not does it commit the Government to acceptance of defective material.\r4.3   Records - Records of all inspection work by the Contractor shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the performance of contract/purchase order and for a period of 365 calendar days after final delivery of supplies.\r5.

        "description_text": "This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for market research purposes. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (Al) is one of the defining technologies of our era. Its emergence, together with its multiplying contexts of use and increasing capabilities, presents enormous opportunities.\n\nTo enable the U.S. economy to harness the full benefits of AI, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) focuses on fundamental research and improving AI measurement science, technology, standards and related tools.[1]\n\nThe U.S. AI Safety Institute (AISI), housed within the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is developing testing, evaluations, and guidelines to help accelerate trustworthy AI innovation in the United States and around the world, with a focus on promoting measurement science for AI capabilities and helping to prevent flaws or misuses of AI technology that could undermine public safety or national security.[2]\n\nAs part of this work, AISI is conducting testing, evaluation, validation, and verification (TEVV) on high-impact frontier models&rsquo; capabilities. In doing so, AISI seeks to ensure that its projects, evaluations, and tools reflect the best available science, and to coordinate closely with a diverse set of Al stakeholders who are developing and conducting evaluations to assess capabilities, functionality, and risks.\n\nNIST is performing market research to identify potential sources for an anticipated contract to assist in developing evaluations and benchmarks of AI models&#39; relevant software engineering and AI research and development capabilities, functionality, and risks.\n\nPOTENTIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS\n\nThe following requirements are provided to describe the Government&#39;s minimum needs. As the acquisition planning process proceeds, requirements may be modified.\n\nThe Contractor must provide or develop resources for various aspects of assessing the capability of frontier Al models to assist in software engineering and AI research and development, including by assessing the quality or functionality of AI-generated outputs in these domains and any corresponding risks.  The Contractor would be responsible to conduct one or more of the tasks in list A in order to assess one or more of the capabilities in list B.\n\nContractor Tasks: \n\nContractors must provide or develop resources for one or more of the following:\n\n\n\tDeveloping benchmarks and scoring mechanisms for automated evaluation of Al models&#39; relevant capabilities;\n\tDeveloping tasks for automated evaluation of AI models&rsquo; relevant capabilities with accompanying data on human baseline performance (e.g., how long the tasks take human experts to complete);\n\tDesign and implementation of protocols or methods for evaluating AI models&rsquo; relevant capabilities;\n\tDevelopment of technical resources or infrastructure for generating tasks and environments and scoring mechanisms for evaluating AI models&rsquo; relevant capabilities.                     Relevant Model Capabilities: \n\n\nRelevant frontier model capabilities to elicit, evaluate, and benchmark include:\n\n\n\tCapabilities that enable a model to assist with or automate software development activities such as designing and implementing projects based on specifications, identifying and correcting bugs, updating and refactoring code, or deploying code;\n\tCapabilities that enable a model to assist with or automate research activities associated with frontier AI model development, such as the ability to generate and test hypotheses relating to the design of AI models or to perform iterative experimentation;\n\tCapabilities that enable a model to assist with or automate engineering and infrastructure management activities associated with frontier AI model development, such as managing large-scale model training processes;\n\tCapabilities that enable a model to subvert or interfere with software or AI development or usage processes, such as by using sabotage, deception, or self-exfiltration;\n\tOther capabilities that are relevant to significantly assisting with or automating processes of software development or AI research and development, or that could create risks related to such processes.\n\n\nINFORMATION FOR SUBMISSION\n\nNIST is seeking responses from responsible sources. Responses are being sought from all business sizes.\n\nAfter the results of this market research are obtained and analyzed, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a contract.\n\nThe NAICS code for this effort is 541990 Professional, Scientific and Technical Services. The small business size standard is $19.0M. If a small business set-aside results, a Limitation on Subcontracting clause will be applicable to the anticipated procurement action. Businesses meeting the classification of the set-aside cannot pay more than 50% of the amount paid to it, by the Government, to firms that are not similarly situated.\n\nResponses to this sources sought shall not exceed 15 pages in length and must demonstrate the respondent&#39;s capabilities related to the potential contract requirements; responses must be detailed  beyond a standard capability statement.\n\nThe following information must be provided in response to this sources sought notice:\n\n\n\tName of company(ies), their addresses, Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) for the company&#39;s active System for Award Management (SAM.gov) website registration, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address) that provide the services for which information is provided.\n\n\n           Interested parties that do not have an active SAM.gov registration are strongly encouraged                         to immediately begin the registration process. This process can take several weeks to                                 complete. Parties responding to Government solicitations must have an active registration at                      SAM.Gov in order for a quotation or proposal to be considered for award.\n\n        2.

These services will support the ISMT Operations and Maintenance. Fleet Marine Force and Marine Force Reserves ISMT systems are located both inside the Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS). \n\nThe ISMT Systems are interactive audio/video simulators that provide network capable training in marksmanship, weapons employment, indirect fire, and tactical decision- making. The ISMT systems incorporate the use of simulated organic Infantry Battalion Table of Equipment (T/E) weapons to enable Marines and Sailors to train and rehearse skills for marksmanship, weapons employment, tactical engagement, and tactical decision making. Up to three ISMT systems can be networked together and used simultaneously. When networked together, the configuration is commonly referred to as an Infantry Squad Trainer (IST). In this configuration, 15 firing points for known and unknown distance ranges can be supported, with up to 24 assigned weapons while executing scenarios within a virtual battle space. The ISMT also supports Crew Served Weapons (CSWs) employment training to augmenting live fire training with simulated qualification tables of fire, added repetitions of target engagements allowing for further Standing Operating Procedure (SOP) refinement, and simulated collective environments where CSWs support infantry maneuver. \n\nThe Offeror shall manage the configuration of the training system to ensure the system and system components are using the correct software baseline.

If work was performed as a subcontractor, please indicate percentage of work/subcontract dollar value. If the contract(s) were Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ), please indicate the number of task orders awarded and the total dollar value of those task orders. \n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\nIn addition to the information requested above, interested parties may also provide comments on this potential acquisition regarding proposed contract type, incentive arrangements, evaluation criteria, or performance metrics.  \n\nThe government will evaluate market information to ascertain potential market capacity to 1) provide services consistent in scope and scale with those described in this notice and otherwise anticipated; and 2) determine whether to conduct a competition with full and open competition or through a small business set-aside.  To assess the market capacity, the government will review potential offeror&rsquo;s past performance with respect to this type of work; and Experience providing services under a performance-based service acquisition contract. \n\nNASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.  The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at: https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/Procurement-Ombuds-Comp-Advocate-Listing.pdf \n\nOrganizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) \n\nIn addition to the information requested above, NASA is requesting information from industry regarding potential OCI arising from the SASS II acquisition. \n\nThe nature of the work anticipated under the SASS II may create the potential for OCI(s) as currently described in FAR Subpart 9.5.  Each interested party should review FAR Subpart 9.5 in light of NASA&rsquo;s anticipation of OCI issues and consider carefully the extent to which an OCI may arise before making the decision to compete for the SASS II.  \n\nSpecifically, NASA anticipates that the effort under the SASS II will include the following types of tasks which could lead to potential OCI issues.  This list is not all inclusive.  \n\n\n\t\n\tThe Contractor may be required to provide technical support to NASA for new systems development for current and future programs/missions. (e.g. Orion, ISS, Gateway, etc.) \n\t\n\t\n\tThe Contractor may be required to inspect, evaluate, access, critique, review, or perform other similar services with respect to products or services provided by the Contractor under other NASA contracts. \n\t\n\t\n\tThis effort may require direct simulation and advance software service functions to the JSC Engineering, Flight Operations, and Human Health Performance Directorates and their contractor developed products. \n\t\n\n\nA link to the NASA&rsquo;s Guide on OCI is listed below: https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/guides/OCI_Guide.pdf \n\nPlease reference this document for additional information about NASA&rsquo;s policies with respect to OCI issues. Interested parties are requested to address the following questions: \n\n1. What type(s) of OCI issues would your company or potential team identify, if any, should you choose to propose on the SASS II contract?  \n\n2. What strategies would you anticipate proposing to mitigate the OCI issues that you identified (if any)?  Please provide strategy details, previous examples/experience with other contracts with NASA or other agencies, etc. \n\n3. Are there any other types of potential OCI issues with the proposed SASS II contract that were not identified in this RFI (assuming any were identified)? \n\n4. Does your company foresee any OCI issues associated with the SASS II that would cause you to decide not to propose on the potential SASS II RFP? \n\nNASA will review any responses received regarding potential OCI and each offeror&rsquo;s proposed OCI mitigation strategy.  NASA will respond to each company who submits a mitigation strategy.  NASA&rsquo;s response is not intended to serve as a confirmation that, in fact, all potential OCI have been identified, an OCI will ultimately exist, or that an interested party is capable of successfully eliminating or mitigating an identified OCI.  NASA&rsquo;s response is also not intended to encourage or discourage any interested party from responding to an RFP issued for SASS II in the future.  Furthermore, NASA&rsquo;s response in no way alters or interprets FAR 9.5 as it applies to a final statement of work or a final proposal submission, should an interest party elect to submit a proposal to an RFP for SASS II.  Subsequent to the initial OCI submission and NASA&rsquo;s response, NASA will not consider further information as it relates to this RFI. \n\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility \n\nIn support of the Executive Order (EO) 13985, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, NASA is seeking to advance equity or remove barriers for members of underserved communities related to this requirement. As defined in the EO, Underserved Communities refers to populations sharing a particular characteristic, as well as geographic communities, that have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic, social, and civic life, as exemplified by the list in the preceding definition of &quot;equity.&quot; Equity means the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. \n\nNASA seeks input in the following areas: \n\n1. To support the requirements identified in this request for information (RFI)/sources sought notification, what barriers or opportunities exist to engage subject matter experts from industry and academia and how can those barriers be overcome? How can underserved communities be leveraged? \n\n2. To support the requirements identified in this RFI, what barriers or opportunities exist to partner with subcontractors that employ members of underserved communities, as defined above? \n\n3. What other recommendations would you make to enhance diversity and inclusion? \n\n4. What should be considered to encourage full participation and contribution of organizations and individuals (e.g., outreach efforts and innovative partnerships) in performance of this requirement? \n\nSubmission Instructions  \n\nInterested parties having the required capabilities necessary to meet the SASS II requirement described herein should submit a capability statement of no more than 7 pages, using no less than 12-point Times New Roman font indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort. The Vendor Capability Matrix will be included within the 7-page limitation. The OCI information should be submitted as an additional document. There is no page limitation to the OCI information submittal. \n\nInterested parties who consider themselves qualified one or more elements of the Statement of Work are invited to submit a response to this Sources Sought Notice by June 7, 2024. All questions and responses under this Sources Sought Notice must be emailed to Carlos Roman at carlos.roman@nasa.gov and Yushu Mao at yushu.mao@nasa.gov.

To assess the market capacity, the government will review potential offeror&rsquo;s past performance with respect to this type of work; and Experience providing services under a performance-based service acquisition contract. \n\nNASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.  The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at: https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/Procurement-Ombuds-Comp-Advocate-Listing.pdf \n\nOrganizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) \n\nIn addition to the information requested above, NASA is requesting information from industry regarding potential OCI arising from the SASS II acquisition. \n\nThe nature of the work anticipated under the SASS II may create the potential for OCI(s) as currently described in FAR Subpart 9.5.  Each interested party should review FAR Subpart 9.5 in light of NASA&rsquo;s anticipation of OCI issues and consider carefully the extent to which an OCI may arise before making the decision to compete for the SASS II.  \n\nSpecifically, NASA anticipates that the effort under the SASS II will include the following types of tasks which could lead to potential OCI issues.  This list is not all inclusive.  \n\n\n\t\n\tThe Contractor may be required to provide technical support to NASA for new systems development for current and future programs/missions. (e.g. Orion, ISS, Gateway, etc.) \n\t\n\t\n\tThe Contractor may be required to inspect, evaluate, access, critique, review, or perform other similar services with respect to products or services provided by the Contractor under other NASA contracts. \n\t\n\t\n\tThis effort may require direct simulation and advance software service functions to the JSC Engineering, Flight Operations, and Human Health Performance Directorates and their contractor developed products. \n\t\n\n\nA link to the NASA&rsquo;s Guide on OCI is listed below: https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/guides/OCI_Guide.pdf \n\nPlease reference this document for additional information about NASA&rsquo;s policies with respect to OCI issues. Interested parties are requested to address the following questions: \n\n1. What type(s) of OCI issues would your company or potential team identify, if any, should you choose to propose on the SASS II contract?  \n\n2. What strategies would you anticipate proposing to mitigate the OCI issues that you identified (if any)?  Please provide strategy details, previous examples/experience with other contracts with NASA or other agencies, etc. \n\n3. Are there any other types of potential OCI issues with the proposed SASS II contract that were not identified in this RFI (assuming any were identified)? \n\n4. Does your company foresee any OCI issues associated with the SASS II that would cause you to decide not to propose on the potential SASS II RFP? \n\nNASA will review any responses received regarding potential OCI and each offeror&rsquo;s proposed OCI mitigation strategy.  NASA will respond to each company who submits a mitigation strategy.  NASA&rsquo;s response is not intended to serve as a confirmation that, in fact, all potential OCI have been identified, an OCI will ultimately exist, or that an interested party is capable of successfully eliminating or mitigating an identified OCI.  NASA&rsquo;s response is also not intended to encourage or discourage any interested party from responding to an RFP issued for SASS II in the future.  Furthermore, NASA&rsquo;s response in no way alters or interprets FAR 9.5 as it applies to a final statement of work or a final proposal submission, should an interest party elect to submit a proposal to an RFP for SASS II.  Subsequent to the initial OCI submission and NASA&rsquo;s response, NASA will not consider further information as it relates to this RFI. \n\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility \n\nIn support of the Executive Order (EO) 13985, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, NASA is seeking to advance equity or remove barriers for members of underserved communities related to this requirement. As defined in the EO, Underserved Communities refers to populations sharing a particular characteristic, as well as geographic communities, that have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic, social, and civic life, as exemplified by the list in the preceding definition of &quot;equity.&quot; Equity means the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. \n\nNASA seeks input in the following areas: \n\n1. To support the requirements identified in this request for information (RFI)/sources sought notification, what barriers or opportunities exist to engage subject matter experts from industry and academia and how can those barriers be overcome? How can underserved communities be leveraged? \n\n2. To support the requirements identified in this RFI, what barriers or opportunities exist to partner with subcontractors that employ members of underserved communities, as defined above? \n\n3. What other recommendations would you make to enhance diversity and inclusion? \n\n4. What should be considered to encourage full participation and contribution of organizations and individuals (e.g., outreach efforts and innovative partnerships) in performance of this requirement? \n\nSubmission Instructions  \n\nInterested parties having the required capabilities necessary to meet the SASS II requirement described herein should submit a capability statement of no more than 7 pages, using no less than 12-point Times New Roman font indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort.

Johnson Space Center (JSC) is hereby requesting information from potential sources for the Simulation and Advanced Software Services II (SASS II) solicitation. JSC is issuing this sources sought synopsis as a means of conducting market research to identify parties having an interest in and the resources to support this requirement, seeking capability statement, and requesting information from industry regarding potential organizational conflicts of interest (OCI) arising from this requirement. This acquisition will be a follow-on procurement to the current NASA Simulation and Advanced Software Service (SASS), Contract #80JSC020D0060. The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services. Under this NAICS code, a business is considered small if its average annual receipts are less than $34 million. \n\nThe NASA/JSC is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including all socioeconomic categories of Small Businesses and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI), and members of the underserved communities as defined by Executive Order 13985, Advancing Racial Equity And Support For Underserved Communities Through The Federal Government, for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for SASS II. The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Women-owned (WOSB), Service-Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), Economically Disadvantaged Women-owned Small Business (EDWOSB) or HUBZone business set-aside based on responses received. \n\nSASS II Description \n\nNASA has a requirement for specialized simulation services in the areas of space-based robotics; avionics; vehicle guidance, navigation, and control (GN&amp;C); graphics; and flight software; as well as advanced software services in the areas of software development technology, human-computer interaction; avionics flight software; and collaborative engineering and process automation. These services are necessary to produce software systems, processes, and tools for a variety of end-users across the agency, including but not limited to the International Space Station (ISS), Orion, Gateway, and Artemis Programs, Flight Operations, and other advanced programs for exploration. \n\nThe pertinent contract information for the current contract is as follows: \n\n\n\t\n\tCurrent Contractor: MACLEAN ENGINEERING &amp; APPLIED TECHNOLOGIES (METECS) \n\t\n\t\n\tContract Number: 80JSC020D0060 \n\t\n\t\n\tEstimated Contract Value: $100 million \n\t\n\t\n\tContract Expiration Date: 09/30/2025 \n\t\n\n\nVendors having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references. \n\nCapability Statement \n\nInterested firms having the required capabilities necessary to meet the above requirement should indicate the ability to perform all aspects of the effort, and include the following information: \n\n\n\t\n\tTechnical \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tDescribe your company&#39;s overall skills, experience, and capabilities to perform the work of the Attachment 1 - Draft SOW. Please identify specific Draft SOW sections where your company could provide the stated capability by way of Attachment 2 - Vendor Capability Matrix at the end of this announcement. Any referenced DRDs in the Draft SOW are not applicable to this Request for Information. If subcontracting or joint venture is anticipated to deliver technical capability, organizations should address the anticipated administrative and management structure of such arrangements (if this information is known at this time). Also address what elements of work would be performed by the prime or joint venture and which elements would be performed by subcontractors. \n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tSmall Business - If this contract is not set aside, identify any areas of the Draft SOW that you believe could be performed by a small business and provide rationale. \n\t\n\t\n\tCompany-Specific Information - Responses must include the following: \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tName and address of firm&rsquo;s Point of Contact information (include DUNS number, address, website, phone number, and email address). \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSize of business. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tAverage annual revenue for past three years. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tNumber of employees. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tWhether the firm is a Large, SB, SDB, HUBZone, WOSB, VOSB, SDVOSB, HBCU/MI, and/or 8a. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tNumber of years in business. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tAffiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, and potential teaming partners. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tIf you plan to propose as a prime or as a subcontractor. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tA list of contracts covering the past three years with emphasis on work performed for the United States Federal Government. Please provide contract numbers, if your firm was a prime or subcontractor, contract type, dollar value of each procurement, and customer point of contact (address, phone, and email). If work was performed as a subcontractor, please indicate percentage of work/subcontract dollar value. If the contract(s) were Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ), please indicate the number of task orders awarded and the total dollar value of those task orders. \n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\nIn addition to the information requested above, interested parties may also provide comments on this potential acquisition regarding proposed contract type, incentive arrangements, evaluation criteria, or performance metrics.  \n\nThe government will evaluate market information to ascertain potential market capacity to 1) provide services consistent in scope and scale with those described in this notice and otherwise anticipated; and 2) determine whether to conduct a competition with full and open competition or through a small business set-aside.  To assess the market capacity, the government will review potential offeror&rsquo;s past performance with respect to this type of work; and Experience providing services under a performance-based service acquisition contract. \n\nNASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.  The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at: https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/Procurement-Ombuds-Comp-Advocate-Listing.pdf \n\nOrganizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) \n\nIn addition to the information requested above, NASA is requesting information from industry regarding potential OCI arising from the SASS II acquisition. \n\nThe nature of the work anticipated under the SASS II may create the potential for OCI(s) as currently described in FAR Subpart 9.5.  Each interested party should review FAR Subpart 9.5 in light of NASA&rsquo;s anticipation of OCI issues and consider carefully the extent to which an OCI may arise before making the decision to compete for the SASS II.  \n\nSpecifically, NASA anticipates that the effort under the SASS II will include the following types of tasks which could lead to potential OCI issues.  This list is not all inclusive.  \n\n\n\t\n\tThe Contractor may be required to provide technical support to NASA for new systems development for current and future programs/missions. (e.g. Orion, ISS, Gateway, etc.) \n\t\n\t\n\tThe Contractor may be required to inspect, evaluate, access, critique, review, or perform other similar services with respect to products or services provided by the Contractor under other NASA contracts. \n\t\n\t\n\tThis effort may require direct simulation and advance software service functions to the JSC Engineering, Flight Operations, and Human Health Performance Directorates and their contractor developed products. \n\t\n\n\nA link to the NASA&rsquo;s Guide on OCI is listed below: https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/guides/OCI_Guide.pdf \n\nPlease reference this document for additional information about NASA&rsquo;s policies with respect to OCI issues. Interested parties are requested to address the following questions: \n\n1. What type(s) of OCI issues would your company or potential team identify, if any, should you choose to propose on the SASS II contract?  \n\n2. What strategies would you anticipate proposing to mitigate the OCI issues that you identified (if any)?  Please provide strategy details, previous examples/experience with other contracts with NASA or other agencies, etc. \n\n3. Are there any other types of potential OCI issues with the proposed SASS II contract that were not identified in this RFI (assuming any were identified)? \n\n4. Does your company foresee any OCI issues associated with the SASS II that would cause you to decide not to propose on the potential SASS II RFP? \n\nNASA will review any responses received regarding potential OCI and each offeror&rsquo;s proposed OCI mitigation strategy.  NASA will respond to each company who submits a mitigation strategy.  NASA&rsquo;s response is not intended to serve as a confirmation that, in fact, all potential OCI have been identified, an OCI will ultimately exist, or that an interested party is capable of successfully eliminating or mitigating an identified OCI.  NASA&rsquo;s response is also not intended to encourage or discourage any interested party from responding to an RFP issued for SASS II in the future.  Furthermore, NASA&rsquo;s response in no way alters or interprets FAR 9.5 as it applies to a final statement of work or a final proposal submission, should an interest party elect to submit a proposal to an RFP for SASS II.  Subsequent to the initial OCI submission and NASA&rsquo;s response, NASA will not consider further information as it relates to this RFI. \n\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility \n\nIn support of the Executive Order (EO) 13985, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, NASA is seeking to advance equity or remove barriers for members of underserved communities related to this requirement. As defined in the EO, Underserved Communities refers to populations sharing a particular characteristic, as well as geographic communities, that have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic, social, and civic life, as exemplified by the list in the preceding definition of &quot;equity.&quot; Equity means the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. \n\nNASA seeks input in the following areas: \n\n1. To support the requirements identified in this request for information (RFI)/sources sought notification, what barriers or opportunities exist to engage subject matter experts from industry and academia and how can those barriers be overcome? How can underserved communities be leveraged? \n\n2. To support the requirements identified in this RFI, what barriers or opportunities exist to partner with subcontractors that employ members of underserved communities, as defined above? \n\n3. What other recommendations would you make to enhance diversity and inclusion? \n\n4. What should be considered to encourage full participation and contribution of organizations and individuals (e.g., outreach efforts and innovative partnerships) in performance of this requirement? \n\nSubmission Instructions  \n\nInterested parties having the required capabilities necessary to meet the SASS II requirement described herein should submit a capability statement of no more than 7 pages, using no less than 12-point Times New Roman font indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort. The Vendor Capability Matrix will be included within the 7-page limitation. The OCI information should be submitted as an additional document. There is no page limitation to the OCI information submittal. \n\nInterested parties who consider themselves qualified one or more elements of the Statement of Work are invited to submit a response to this Sources Sought Notice by June 7, 2024. All questions and responses under this Sources Sought Notice must be emailed to Carlos Roman at carlos.roman@nasa.gov and Yushu Mao at yushu.mao@nasa.gov.

Johnson Space Center (JSC) is hereby requesting information from potential sources for the Simulation and Advanced Software Services II (SASS II) solicitation. JSC is issuing this sources sought synopsis as a means of conducting market research to identify parties having an interest in and the resources to support this requirement, seeking capability statement, and requesting information from industry regarding potential organizational conflicts of interest (OCI) arising from this requirement. This acquisition will be a follow-on procurement to the current NASA Simulation and Advanced Software Service (SASS), Contract #80JSC020D0060. The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services. Under this NAICS code, a business is considered small if its average annual receipts are less than $34 million. \n\nThe NASA/JSC is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including all socioeconomic categories of Small Businesses and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI), and members of the underserved communities as defined by Executive Order 13985, Advancing Racial Equity And Support For Underserved Communities Through The Federal Government, for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for SASS II. The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Women-owned (WOSB), Service-Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), Economically Disadvantaged Women-owned Small Business (EDWOSB) or HUBZone business set-aside based on responses received. \n\nSASS II Description \n\nNASA has a requirement for specialized simulation services in the areas of space-based robotics; avionics; vehicle guidance, navigation, and control (GN&amp;C); graphics; and flight software; as well as advanced software services in the areas of software development technology, human-computer interaction; avionics flight software; and collaborative engineering and process automation. These services are necessary to produce software systems, processes, and tools for a variety of end-users across the agency, including but not limited to the International Space Station (ISS), Orion, Gateway, and Artemis Programs, Flight Operations, and other advanced programs for exploration. \n\nThe pertinent contract information for the current contract is as follows: \n\n\n\t\n\tCurrent Contractor: MACLEAN ENGINEERING &amp; APPLIED TECHNOLOGIES (METECS) \n\t\n\t\n\tContract Number: 80JSC020D0060 \n\t\n\t\n\tEstimated Contract Value: $100 million \n\t\n\t\n\tContract Expiration Date: 09/30/2025 \n\t\n\n\nVendors having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references. \n\nCapability Statement \n\nInterested firms having the required capabilities necessary to meet the above requirement should indicate the ability to perform all aspects of the effort, and include the following information: \n\n\n\t\n\tTechnical \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tDescribe your company&#39;s overall skills, experience, and capabilities to perform the work of the Attachment 1 - Draft SOW. Please identify specific Draft SOW sections where your company could provide the stated capability by way of Attachment 2 - Vendor Capability Matrix at the end of this announcement. Any referenced DRDs in the Draft SOW are not applicable to this Request for Information. If subcontracting or joint venture is anticipated to deliver technical capability, organizations should address the anticipated administrative and management structure of such arrangements (if this information is known at this time). Also address what elements of work would be performed by the prime or joint venture and which elements would be performed by subcontractors. \n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tSmall Business - If this contract is not set aside, identify any areas of the Draft SOW that you believe could be performed by a small business and provide rationale. \n\t\n\t\n\tCompany-Specific Information - Responses must include the following: \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tName and address of firm&rsquo;s Point of Contact information (include DUNS number, address, website, phone number, and email address). \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSize of business. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tAverage annual revenue for past three years. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tNumber of employees. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tWhether the firm is a Large, SB, SDB, HUBZone, WOSB, VOSB, SDVOSB, HBCU/MI, and/or 8a. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tNumber of years in business. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tAffiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, and potential teaming partners. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tIf you plan to propose as a prime or as a subcontractor. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tA list of contracts covering the past three years with emphasis on work performed for the United States Federal Government. Please provide contract numbers, if your firm was a prime or subcontractor, contract type, dollar value of each procurement, and customer point of contact (address, phone, and email). If work was performed as a subcontractor, please indicate percentage of work/subcontract dollar value. If the contract(s) were Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ), please indicate the number of task orders awarded and the total dollar value of those task orders. \n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\nIn addition to the information requested above, interested parties may also provide comments on this potential acquisition regarding proposed contract type, incentive arrangements, evaluation criteria, or performance metrics.  \n\nThe government will evaluate market information to ascertain potential market capacity to 1) provide services consistent in scope and scale with those described in this notice and otherwise anticipated; and 2) determine whether to conduct a competition with full and open competition or through a small business set-aside.  To assess the market capacity, the government will review potential offeror&rsquo;s past performance with respect to this type of work; and Experience providing services under a performance-based service acquisition contract. \n\nNASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.  The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at: https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/Procurement-Ombuds-Comp-Advocate-Listing.pdf \n\nOrganizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) \n\nIn addition to the information requested above, NASA is requesting information from industry regarding potential OCI arising from the SASS II acquisition. \n\nThe nature of the work anticipated under the SASS II may create the potential for OCI(s) as currently described in FAR Subpart 9.5.  Each interested party should review FAR Subpart 9.5 in light of NASA&rsquo;s anticipation of OCI issues and consider carefully the extent to which an OCI may arise before making the decision to compete for the SASS II.  \n\nSpecifically, NASA anticipates that the effort under the SASS II will include the following types of tasks which could lead to potential OCI issues.  This list is not all inclusive.  \n\n\n\t\n\tThe Contractor may be required to provide technical support to NASA for new systems development for current and future programs/missions. (e.g. Orion, ISS, Gateway, etc.) \n\t\n\t\n\tThe Contractor may be required to inspect, evaluate, access, critique, review, or perform other similar services with respect to products or services provided by the Contractor under other NASA contracts. \n\t\n\t\n\tThis effort may require direct simulation and advance software service functions to the JSC Engineering, Flight Operations, and Human Health Performance Directorates and their contractor developed products. \n\t\n\n\nA link to the NASA&rsquo;s Guide on OCI is listed below: https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/guides/OCI_Guide.pdf \n\nPlease reference this document for additional information about NASA&rsquo;s policies with respect to OCI issues. Interested parties are requested to address the following questions: \n\n1. What type(s) of OCI issues would your company or potential team identify, if any, should you choose to propose on the SASS II contract?  \n\n2. What strategies would you anticipate proposing to mitigate the OCI issues that you identified (if any)?  Please provide strategy details, previous examples/experience with other contracts with NASA or other agencies, etc. \n\n3. Are there any other types of potential OCI issues with the proposed SASS II contract that were not identified in this RFI (assuming any were identified)? \n\n4. Does your company foresee any OCI issues associated with the SASS II that would cause you to decide not to propose on the potential SASS II RFP? \n\nNASA will review any responses received regarding potential OCI and each offeror&rsquo;s proposed OCI mitigation strategy.  NASA will respond to each company who submits a mitigation strategy.  NASA&rsquo;s response is not intended to serve as a confirmation that, in fact, all potential OCI have been identified, an OCI will ultimately exist, or that an interested party is capable of successfully eliminating or mitigating an identified OCI.  NASA&rsquo;s response is also not intended to encourage or discourage any interested party from responding to an RFP issued for SASS II in the future.  Furthermore, NASA&rsquo;s response in no way alters or interprets FAR 9.5 as it applies to a final statement of work or a final proposal submission, should an interest party elect to submit a proposal to an RFP for SASS II.  Subsequent to the initial OCI submission and NASA&rsquo;s response, NASA will not consider further information as it relates to this RFI. \n\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility \n\nIn support of the Executive Order (EO) 13985, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, NASA is seeking to advance equity or remove barriers for members of underserved communities related to this requirement. As defined in the EO, Underserved Communities refers to populations sharing a particular characteristic, as well as geographic communities, that have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic, social, and civic life, as exemplified by the list in the preceding definition of &quot;equity.&quot; Equity means the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. \n\nNASA seeks input in the following areas: \n\n1. To support the requirements identified in this request for information (RFI)/sources sought notification, what barriers or opportunities exist to engage subject matter experts from industry and academia and how can those barriers be overcome? How can underserved communities be leveraged? \n\n2. To support the requirements identified in this RFI, what barriers or opportunities exist to partner with subcontractors that employ members of underserved communities, as defined above? \n\n3. What other recommendations would you make to enhance diversity and inclusion? \n\n4. What should be considered to encourage full participation and contribution of organizations and individuals (e.g., outreach efforts and innovative partnerships) in performance of this requirement? \n\nSubmission Instructions  \n\nInterested parties having the required capabilities necessary to meet the SASS II requirement described herein should submit a capability statement of no more than 7 pages, using no less than 12-point Times New Roman font indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort. The Vendor Capability Matrix will be included within the 7-page limitation. The OCI information should be submitted as an additional document. There is no page limitation to the OCI information submittal. \n\nInterested parties who consider themselves qualified one or more elements of the Statement of Work are invited to submit a response to this Sources Sought Notice by June 7, 2024. All questions and responses under this Sources Sought Notice must be emailed to Carlos Roman at carlos.roman@nasa.gov and Yushu Mao at yushu.mao@nasa.gov.

To assess the market capacity, the government will review potential offeror&rsquo;s past performance with respect to this type of work; and Experience providing services under a performance-based service acquisition contract. \n\nNASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.  The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at: https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/Procurement-Ombuds-Comp-Advocate-Listing.pdf \n\nOrganizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) \n\nIn addition to the information requested above, NASA is requesting information from industry regarding potential OCI arising from the SASS II acquisition. \n\nThe nature of the work anticipated under the SASS II may create the potential for OCI(s) as currently described in FAR Subpart 9.5.  Each interested party should review FAR Subpart 9.5 in light of NASA&rsquo;s anticipation of OCI issues and consider carefully the extent to which an OCI may arise before making the decision to compete for the SASS II.  \n\nSpecifically, NASA anticipates that the effort under the SASS II will include the following types of tasks which could lead to potential OCI issues.  This list is not all inclusive.  \n\n\n\t\n\tThe Contractor may be required to provide technical support to NASA for new systems development for current and future programs/missions. (e.g. Orion, ISS, Gateway, etc.) \n\t\n\t\n\tThe Contractor may be required to inspect, evaluate, access, critique, review, or perform other similar services with respect to products or services provided by the Contractor under other NASA contracts. \n\t\n\t\n\tThis effort may require direct simulation and advance software service functions to the JSC Engineering, Flight Operations, and Human Health Performance Directorates and their contractor developed products. \n\t\n\n\nA link to the NASA&rsquo;s Guide on OCI is listed below: https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/guides/OCI_Guide.pdf \n\nPlease reference this document for additional information about NASA&rsquo;s policies with respect to OCI issues. Interested parties are requested to address the following questions: \n\n1. What type(s) of OCI issues would your company or potential team identify, if any, should you choose to propose on the SASS II contract?  \n\n2. What strategies would you anticipate proposing to mitigate the OCI issues that you identified (if any)?  Please provide strategy details, previous examples/experience with other contracts with NASA or other agencies, etc. \n\n3. Are there any other types of potential OCI issues with the proposed SASS II contract that were not identified in this RFI (assuming any were identified)? \n\n4. Does your company foresee any OCI issues associated with the SASS II that would cause you to decide not to propose on the potential SASS II RFP? \n\nNASA will review any responses received regarding potential OCI and each offeror&rsquo;s proposed OCI mitigation strategy.  NASA will respond to each company who submits a mitigation strategy.  NASA&rsquo;s response is not intended to serve as a confirmation that, in fact, all potential OCI have been identified, an OCI will ultimately exist, or that an interested party is capable of successfully eliminating or mitigating an identified OCI.  NASA&rsquo;s response is also not intended to encourage or discourage any interested party from responding to an RFP issued for SASS II in the future.  Furthermore, NASA&rsquo;s response in no way alters or interprets FAR 9.5 as it applies to a final statement of work or a final proposal submission, should an interest party elect to submit a proposal to an RFP for SASS II.  Subsequent to the initial OCI submission and NASA&rsquo;s response, NASA will not consider further information as it relates to this RFI. \n\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility \n\nIn support of the Executive Order (EO) 13985, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, NASA is seeking to advance equity or remove barriers for members of underserved communities related to this requirement. As defined in the EO, Underserved Communities refers to populations sharing a particular characteristic, as well as geographic communities, that have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic, social, and civic life, as exemplified by the list in the preceding definition of &quot;equity.&quot; Equity means the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. \n\nNASA seeks input in the following areas: \n\n1. To support the requirements identified in this request for information (RFI)/sources sought notification, what barriers or opportunities exist to engage subject matter experts from industry and academia and how can those barriers be overcome? How can underserved communities be leveraged? \n\n2. To support the requirements identified in this RFI, what barriers or opportunities exist to partner with subcontractors that employ members of underserved communities, as defined above? \n\n3. What other recommendations would you make to enhance diversity and inclusion? \n\n4. What should be considered to encourage full participation and contribution of organizations and individuals (e.g., outreach efforts and innovative partnerships) in performance of this requirement? \n\nSubmission Instructions  \n\nInterested parties having the required capabilities necessary to meet the SASS II requirement described herein should submit a capability statement of no more than 7 pages, using no less than 12-point Times New Roman font indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort.

        "description_text": "REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FOR ACOMMS MODELING AND EXPERIMENTAL DEVELOPMENT\n\n\n\nPurpose\n\nThe Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) is seeking information on fully programmable software defined acoustic modems.\n\nDescription\n\nThe modem should be fully software defined with an interface allowing for custom coding and reprogramming of the modulation and demodulation routines. The modem should have similar functionality to software defined radios (SDRs) in the radio frequency domain, in which the entire digital signal processing (DSP) chain can be coded and developed by the user.\n\nThe modem should utilize both CPU and FPGA (field programmable gate array) hardware to handle the DSP. The CPU should support the FPGA, meaning that code on the CPU can directly interface with the signal stream from/to the FPGA. Both should be fully programmable using languages such as C++, python, and/or Verilog.  An FPGA capable of supporting higher level programming interfaces, such as Vivado, and possessing hardened (hard-wired/on-chip) support for modern error correction routines (LDPC / Turbo codes) is preferred. FPGA integration is not required if it can be demonstrated that the CPU alone can handle the DSP requirements to operate in real-time.\n\nThe full package should contain both the hardware for modulation/demodulation and for driving an acoustic transducer at a power of at least 100W. Power draw during receive mode should not exceed 5W. Solutions outside of these power requirements may be considered depending on the suite of features offered by the system. Additionally, a large tunable range of the center frequency (ideally from 1kHz to 1MHz) and a usable bandwidth of at least 20kHz are being targeted.\n\nThe system should have at least 4 transducers used for both input and output. The modem should be able to independently communicate with each transducer to allow for (multiple-input-multiple-output) MIMO and beamforming approaches to be used in both transmit and receive mode.\n\nThe applicable PSC code is 5895. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 334290.  Size Standard is 800 employees.\n\nResponses\n\nPotential offerors with the ability to meet all or the majority of the requirements listed in the Description Specification are requested to provide information on their solution as a Microsoft Word Document or Portable Document Format (PDF) file in memorandum format. Responses to this RFI should include supporting materials that provide a demonstration of your company&rsquo;s capabilities and experience. For costs, please provide any applicable quantity discounts.  The following information is requested (indicate if the information is an estimate or actual). \n\n\n\tProduct Description (including key features/functionality)\n\tPhysical Characteristics\n\tProduct History\n\tUser Interface\n\tProduct Maturity\n\tCost\n\n\nIn addition to illustrating the ability to meet the performance requirements, the following questions must also be answered within this RFI:\n\n1.         As of the posting of this RFI, are a minimum of two (2) production samples available for evaluation that meet all or most of the requirements of this effort? If not, provide an estimate as of the posting of this RFI on when production samples can be made available. \n\n2.         If a commercial item exists, but does not fully meet the above requirements, provide an estimate on when an item would be available to meet the above requirements.\n\n3.         What is the estimated cost per system?\n\n4.         Is a commercial manual available for the item?  If not, provide an estimate for how long it would take to produce one and the associated cost to develop one.\n\nThe cover page of the RFI response should include the following:\n\n1.         Business Name\n\n2.         Business Size/type\n\n3.         Point of Contact Name\n\n4.         Business Address\n\n5.         Phone Number\n\n6.         Email Address\n\nPlease e-mail responses with any supporting pictures or attachments to brandon.d.hayes11.civ@us.navy.mil and label with the solicitation number and title.  NSWC Panama City requests your responses by 26 November 2025.  Questions can be submitted electronically to brandon.d.hayes11.civ@us.navy.mil and nathaniel.j.fuller3.civ@us.navy.mil.\n\nThe technical point of contact is Dr. Nathaniel Fuller, NSWC PCD Code S31, (586) 744-8809, nathaniel.j.fuller3.civ@us.navy.mil.

Johnson Space Center (JSC) is hereby requesting information from potential sources for the Simulation and Advanced Software Services II (SASS II) solicitation. JSC is issuing this sources sought synopsis as a means of conducting market research to identify parties having an interest in and the resources to support this requirement, seeking capability statement, and requesting information from industry regarding potential organizational conflicts of interest (OCI) arising from this requirement. This acquisition will be a follow-on procurement to the current NASA Simulation and Advanced Software Service (SASS), Contract #80JSC020D0060. The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services. Under this NAICS code, a business is considered small if its average annual receipts are less than $34 million. \n\nThe NASA/JSC is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including all socioeconomic categories of Small Businesses and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI), and members of the underserved communities as defined by Executive Order 13985, Advancing Racial Equity And Support For Underserved Communities Through The Federal Government, for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for SASS II. The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Women-owned (WOSB), Service-Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), Economically Disadvantaged Women-owned Small Business (EDWOSB) or HUBZone business set-aside based on responses received. \n\nSASS II Description \n\nNASA has a requirement for specialized simulation services in the areas of space-based robotics; avionics; vehicle guidance, navigation, and control (GN&amp;C); graphics; and flight software; as well as advanced software services in the areas of software development technology, human-computer interaction; avionics flight software; and collaborative engineering and process automation. These services are necessary to produce software systems, processes, and tools for a variety of end-users across the agency, including but not limited to the International Space Station (ISS), Orion, Gateway, and Artemis Programs, Flight Operations, and other advanced programs for exploration. \n\nThe pertinent contract information for the current contract is as follows: \n\n\n\t\n\tCurrent Contractor: MACLEAN ENGINEERING &amp; APPLIED TECHNOLOGIES (METECS) \n\t\n\t\n\tContract Number: 80JSC020D0060 \n\t\n\t\n\tEstimated Contract Value: $100 million \n\t\n\t\n\tContract Expiration Date: 09/30/2025 \n\t\n\n\nVendors having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references. \n\nCapability Statement \n\nInterested firms having the required capabilities necessary to meet the above requirement should indicate the ability to perform all aspects of the effort, and include the following information: \n\n\n\t\n\tTechnical \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tDescribe your company&#39;s overall skills, experience, and capabilities to perform the work of the Attachment 1 - Draft SOW. Please identify specific Draft SOW sections where your company could provide the stated capability by way of Attachment 2 - Vendor Capability Matrix at the end of this announcement. Any referenced DRDs in the Draft SOW are not applicable to this Request for Information. If subcontracting or joint venture is anticipated to deliver technical capability, organizations should address the anticipated administrative and management structure of such arrangements (if this information is known at this time). Also address what elements of work would be performed by the prime or joint venture and which elements would be performed by subcontractors. \n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tSmall Business - If this contract is not set aside, identify any areas of the Draft SOW that you believe could be performed by a small business and provide rationale. \n\t\n\t\n\tCompany-Specific Information - Responses must include the following: \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tName and address of firm&rsquo;s Point of Contact information (include DUNS number, address, website, phone number, and email address). \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSize of business. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tAverage annual revenue for past three years. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tNumber of employees. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tWhether the firm is a Large, SB, SDB, HUBZone, WOSB, VOSB, SDVOSB, HBCU/MI, and/or 8a. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tNumber of years in business. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tAffiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, and potential teaming partners. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tIf you plan to propose as a prime or as a subcontractor. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tA list of contracts covering the past three years with emphasis on work performed for the United States Federal Government. Please provide contract numbers, if your firm was a prime or subcontractor, contract type, dollar value of each procurement, and customer point of contact (address, phone, and email). If work was performed as a subcontractor, please indicate percentage of work/subcontract dollar value. If the contract(s) were Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ), please indicate the number of task orders awarded and the total dollar value of those task orders. \n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\nIn addition to the information requested above, interested parties may also provide comments on this potential acquisition regarding proposed contract type, incentive arrangements, evaluation criteria, or performance metrics.  \n\nThe government will evaluate market information to ascertain potential market capacity to 1) provide services consistent in scope and scale with those described in this notice and otherwise anticipated; and 2) determine whether to conduct a competition with full and open competition or through a small business set-aside.  To assess the market capacity, the government will review potential offeror&rsquo;s past performance with respect to this type of work; and Experience providing services under a performance-based service acquisition contract. \n\nNASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.  The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at: https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/Procurement-Ombuds-Comp-Advocate-Listing.pdf \n\nOrganizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) \n\nIn addition to the information requested above, NASA is requesting information from industry regarding potential OCI arising from the SASS II acquisition. \n\nThe nature of the work anticipated under the SASS II may create the potential for OCI(s) as currently described in FAR Subpart 9.5.  Each interested party should review FAR Subpart 9.5 in light of NASA&rsquo;s anticipation of OCI issues and consider carefully the extent to which an OCI may arise before making the decision to compete for the SASS II.  \n\nSpecifically, NASA anticipates that the effort under the SASS II will include the following types of tasks which could lead to potential OCI issues.  This list is not all inclusive.  \n\n\n\t\n\tThe Contractor may be required to provide technical support to NASA for new systems development for current and future programs/missions. (e.g. Orion, ISS, Gateway, etc.) \n\t\n\t\n\tThe Contractor may be required to inspect, evaluate, access, critique, review, or perform other similar services with respect to products or services provided by the Contractor under other NASA contracts. \n\t\n\t\n\tThis effort may require direct simulation and advance software service functions to the JSC Engineering, Flight Operations, and Human Health Performance Directorates and their contractor developed products. \n\t\n\n\nA link to the NASA&rsquo;s Guide on OCI is listed below: https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/guides/OCI_Guide.pdf \n\nPlease reference this document for additional information about NASA&rsquo;s policies with respect to OCI issues. Interested parties are requested to address the following questions: \n\n1. What type(s) of OCI issues would your company or potential team identify, if any, should you choose to propose on the SASS II contract?  \n\n2. What strategies would you anticipate proposing to mitigate the OCI issues that you identified (if any)?  Please provide strategy details, previous examples/experience with other contracts with NASA or other agencies, etc. \n\n3. Are there any other types of potential OCI issues with the proposed SASS II contract that were not identified in this RFI (assuming any were identified)? \n\n4. Does your company foresee any OCI issues associated with the SASS II that would cause you to decide not to propose on the potential SASS II RFP? \n\nNASA will review any responses received regarding potential OCI and each offeror&rsquo;s proposed OCI mitigation strategy.  NASA will respond to each company who submits a mitigation strategy.  NASA&rsquo;s response is not intended to serve as a confirmation that, in fact, all potential OCI have been identified, an OCI will ultimately exist, or that an interested party is capable of successfully eliminating or mitigating an identified OCI.  NASA&rsquo;s response is also not intended to encourage or discourage any interested party from responding to an RFP issued for SASS II in the future.  Furthermore, NASA&rsquo;s response in no way alters or interprets FAR 9.5 as it applies to a final statement of work or a final proposal submission, should an interest party elect to submit a proposal to an RFP for SASS II.  Subsequent to the initial OCI submission and NASA&rsquo;s response, NASA will not consider further information as it relates to this RFI. \n\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility \n\nIn support of the Executive Order (EO) 13985, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, NASA is seeking to advance equity or remove barriers for members of underserved communities related to this requirement. As defined in the EO, Underserved Communities refers to populations sharing a particular characteristic, as well as geographic communities, that have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic, social, and civic life, as exemplified by the list in the preceding definition of &quot;equity.&quot; Equity means the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. \n\nNASA seeks input in the following areas: \n\n1. To support the requirements identified in this request for information (RFI)/sources sought notification, what barriers or opportunities exist to engage subject matter experts from industry and academia and how can those barriers be overcome? How can underserved communities be leveraged? \n\n2. To support the requirements identified in this RFI, what barriers or opportunities exist to partner with subcontractors that employ members of underserved communities, as defined above? \n\n3. What other recommendations would you make to enhance diversity and inclusion? \n\n4. What should be considered to encourage full participation and contribution of organizations and individuals (e.g., outreach efforts and innovative partnerships) in performance of this requirement? \n\nSubmission Instructions  \n\nInterested parties having the required capabilities necessary to meet the SASS II requirement described herein should submit a capability statement of no more than 7 pages, using no less than 12-point Times New Roman font indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort. The Vendor Capability Matrix will be included within the 7-page limitation. The OCI information should be submitted as an additional document. There is no page limitation to the OCI information submittal. \n\nInterested parties who consider themselves qualified one or more elements of the Statement of Work are invited to submit a response to this Sources Sought Notice by June 7, 2024. All questions and responses under this Sources Sought Notice must be emailed to Carlos Roman at carlos.roman@nasa.gov and Yushu Mao at yushu.mao@nasa.gov.  Please reference 80JSC024SASS2 SASS II in any responses.   \n\nAn Interested Vendors List is enabled within this posting.

Johnson Space Center (JSC) is hereby requesting information from potential sources for the Simulation and Advanced Software Services II (SASS II) solicitation. JSC is issuing this sources sought synopsis as a means of conducting market research to identify parties having an interest in and the resources to support this requirement, seeking capability statement, and requesting information from industry regarding potential organizational conflicts of interest (OCI) arising from this requirement. This acquisition will be a follow-on procurement to the current NASA Simulation and Advanced Software Service (SASS), Contract #80JSC020D0060. The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services. Under this NAICS code, a business is considered small if its average annual receipts are less than $34 million. \n\nThe NASA/JSC is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including all socioeconomic categories of Small Businesses and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI), and members of the underserved communities as defined by Executive Order 13985, Advancing Racial Equity And Support For Underserved Communities Through The Federal Government, for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for SASS II. The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Women-owned (WOSB), Service-Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), Economically Disadvantaged Women-owned Small Business (EDWOSB) or HUBZone business set-aside based on responses received. \n\nSASS II Description \n\nNASA has a requirement for specialized simulation services in the areas of space-based robotics; avionics; vehicle guidance, navigation, and control (GN&amp;C); graphics; and flight software; as well as advanced software services in the areas of software development technology, human-computer interaction; avionics flight software; and collaborative engineering and process automation. These services are necessary to produce software systems, processes, and tools for a variety of end-users across the agency, including but not limited to the International Space Station (ISS), Orion, Gateway, and Artemis Programs, Flight Operations, and other advanced programs for exploration. \n\nThe pertinent contract information for the current contract is as follows: \n\n\n\t\n\tCurrent Contractor: MACLEAN ENGINEERING &amp; APPLIED TECHNOLOGIES (METECS) \n\t\n\t\n\tContract Number: 80JSC020D0060 \n\t\n\t\n\tEstimated Contract Value: $100 million \n\t\n\t\n\tContract Expiration Date: 09/30/2025 \n\t\n\n\nVendors having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references. \n\nCapability Statement \n\nInterested firms having the required capabilities necessary to meet the above requirement should indicate the ability to perform all aspects of the effort, and include the following information: \n\n\n\t\n\tTechnical \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tDescribe your company&#39;s overall skills, experience, and capabilities to perform the work of the Attachment 1 - Draft SOW. Please identify specific Draft SOW sections where your company could provide the stated capability by way of Attachment 2 - Vendor Capability Matrix at the end of this announcement. Any referenced DRDs in the Draft SOW are not applicable to this Request for Information. If subcontracting or joint venture is anticipated to deliver technical capability, organizations should address the anticipated administrative and management structure of such arrangements (if this information is known at this time). Also address what elements of work would be performed by the prime or joint venture and which elements would be performed by subcontractors. \n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tSmall Business - If this contract is not set aside, identify any areas of the Draft SOW that you believe could be performed by a small business and provide rationale. \n\t\n\t\n\tCompany-Specific Information - Responses must include the following: \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tName and address of firm&rsquo;s Point of Contact information (include DUNS number, address, website, phone number, and email address). \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSize of business. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tAverage annual revenue for past three years. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tNumber of employees. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tWhether the firm is a Large, SB, SDB, HUBZone, WOSB, VOSB, SDVOSB, HBCU/MI, and/or 8a. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tNumber of years in business. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tAffiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, and potential teaming partners. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tIf you plan to propose as a prime or as a subcontractor. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tA list of contracts covering the past three years with emphasis on work performed for the United States Federal Government. Please provide contract numbers, if your firm was a prime or subcontractor, contract type, dollar value of each procurement, and customer point of contact (address, phone, and email). If work was performed as a subcontractor, please indicate percentage of work/subcontract dollar value. If the contract(s) were Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ), please indicate the number of task orders awarded and the total dollar value of those task orders. \n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\nIn addition to the information requested above, interested parties may also provide comments on this potential acquisition regarding proposed contract type, incentive arrangements, evaluation criteria, or performance metrics.  \n\nThe government will evaluate market information to ascertain potential market capacity to 1) provide services consistent in scope and scale with those described in this notice and otherwise anticipated; and 2) determine whether to conduct a competition with full and open competition or through a small business set-aside.  To assess the market capacity, the government will review potential offeror&rsquo;s past performance with respect to this type of work; and Experience providing services under a performance-based service acquisition contract. \n\nNASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.  The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at: https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/Procurement-Ombuds-Comp-Advocate-Listing.pdf \n\nOrganizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) \n\nIn addition to the information requested above, NASA is requesting information from industry regarding potential OCI arising from the SASS II acquisition. \n\nThe nature of the work anticipated under the SASS II may create the potential for OCI(s) as currently described in FAR Subpart 9.5.  Each interested party should review FAR Subpart 9.5 in light of NASA&rsquo;s anticipation of OCI issues and consider carefully the extent to which an OCI may arise before making the decision to compete for the SASS II.  \n\nSpecifically, NASA anticipates that the effort under the SASS II will include the following types of tasks which could lead to potential OCI issues.  This list is not all inclusive.  \n\n\n\t\n\tThe Contractor may be required to provide technical support to NASA for new systems development for current and future programs/missions. (e.g. Orion, ISS, Gateway, etc.) \n\t\n\t\n\tThe Contractor may be required to inspect, evaluate, access, critique, review, or perform other similar services with respect to products or services provided by the Contractor under other NASA contracts. \n\t\n\t\n\tThis effort may require direct simulation and advance software service functions to the JSC Engineering, Flight Operations, and Human Health Performance Directorates and their contractor developed products. \n\t\n\n\nA link to the NASA&rsquo;s Guide on OCI is listed below: https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/guides/OCI_Guide.pdf \n\nPlease reference this document for additional information about NASA&rsquo;s policies with respect to OCI issues. Interested parties are requested to address the following questions: \n\n1. What type(s) of OCI issues would your company or potential team identify, if any, should you choose to propose on the SASS II contract?  \n\n2. What strategies would you anticipate proposing to mitigate the OCI issues that you identified (if any)?  Please provide strategy details, previous examples/experience with other contracts with NASA or other agencies, etc. \n\n3. Are there any other types of potential OCI issues with the proposed SASS II contract that were not identified in this RFI (assuming any were identified)? \n\n4. Does your company foresee any OCI issues associated with the SASS II that would cause you to decide not to propose on the potential SASS II RFP? \n\nNASA will review any responses received regarding potential OCI and each offeror&rsquo;s proposed OCI mitigation strategy.  NASA will respond to each company who submits a mitigation strategy.  NASA&rsquo;s response is not intended to serve as a confirmation that, in fact, all potential OCI have been identified, an OCI will ultimately exist, or that an interested party is capable of successfully eliminating or mitigating an identified OCI.  NASA&rsquo;s response is also not intended to encourage or discourage any interested party from responding to an RFP issued for SASS II in the future.  Furthermore, NASA&rsquo;s response in no way alters or interprets FAR 9.5 as it applies to a final statement of work or a final proposal submission, should an interest party elect to submit a proposal to an RFP for SASS II.  Subsequent to the initial OCI submission and NASA&rsquo;s response, NASA will not consider further information as it relates to this RFI. \n\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility \n\nIn support of the Executive Order (EO) 13985, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, NASA is seeking to advance equity or remove barriers for members of underserved communities related to this requirement. As defined in the EO, Underserved Communities refers to populations sharing a particular characteristic, as well as geographic communities, that have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic, social, and civic life, as exemplified by the list in the preceding definition of &quot;equity.&quot; Equity means the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. \n\nNASA seeks input in the following areas: \n\n1. To support the requirements identified in this request for information (RFI)/sources sought notification, what barriers or opportunities exist to engage subject matter experts from industry and academia and how can those barriers be overcome? How can underserved communities be leveraged? \n\n2. To support the requirements identified in this RFI, what barriers or opportunities exist to partner with subcontractors that employ members of underserved communities, as defined above? \n\n3. What other recommendations would you make to enhance diversity and inclusion? \n\n4. What should be considered to encourage full participation and contribution of organizations and individuals (e.g., outreach efforts and innovative partnerships) in performance of this requirement? \n\nSubmission Instructions  \n\nInterested parties having the required capabilities necessary to meet the SASS II requirement described herein should submit a capability statement of no more than 7 pages, using no less than 12-point Times New Roman font indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort. The Vendor Capability Matrix will be included within the 7-page limitation. The OCI information should be submitted as an additional document. There is no page limitation to the OCI information submittal. \n\nInterested parties who consider themselves qualified one or more elements of the Statement of Work are invited to submit a response to this Sources Sought Notice by June 7, 2024. All questions and responses under this Sources Sought Notice must be emailed to Carlos Roman at carlos.roman@nasa.gov and Yushu Mao at yushu.mao@nasa.gov.

Please identify specific Draft SOW sections where your company could provide the stated capability by way of Attachment 2 - Vendor Capability Matrix at the end of this announcement. Any referenced DRDs in the Draft SOW are not applicable to this Request for Information. If subcontracting or joint venture is anticipated to deliver technical capability, organizations should address the anticipated administrative and management structure of such arrangements (if this information is known at this time). Also address what elements of work would be performed by the prime or joint venture and which elements would be performed by subcontractors. \n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tSmall Business - If this contract is not set aside, identify any areas of the Draft SOW that you believe could be performed by a small business and provide rationale. \n\t\n\t\n\tCompany-Specific Information - Responses must include the following: \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tName and address of firm&rsquo;s Point of Contact information (include DUNS number, address, website, phone number, and email address). \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSize of business. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tAverage annual revenue for past three years. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tNumber of employees. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tWhether the firm is a Large, SB, SDB, HUBZone, WOSB, VOSB, SDVOSB, HBCU/MI, and/or 8a. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tNumber of years in business. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tAffiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, and potential teaming partners. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tIf you plan to propose as a prime or as a subcontractor. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tA list of contracts covering the past three years with emphasis on work performed for the United States Federal Government. Please provide contract numbers, if your firm was a prime or subcontractor, contract type, dollar value of each procurement, and customer point of contact (address, phone, and email). If work was performed as a subcontractor, please indicate percentage of work/subcontract dollar value. If the contract(s) were Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ), please indicate the number of task orders awarded and the total dollar value of those task orders. \n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\nIn addition to the information requested above, interested parties may also provide comments on this potential acquisition regarding proposed contract type, incentive arrangements, evaluation criteria, or performance metrics.  \n\nThe government will evaluate market information to ascertain potential market capacity to 1) provide services consistent in scope and scale with those described in this notice and otherwise anticipated; and 2) determine whether to conduct a competition with full and open competition or through a small business set-aside.  To assess the market capacity, the government will review potential offeror&rsquo;s past performance with respect to this type of work; and Experience providing services under a performance-based service acquisition contract. \n\nNASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.  The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at: https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/Procurement-Ombuds-Comp-Advocate-Listing.pdf \n\nOrganizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) \n\nIn addition to the information requested above, NASA is requesting information from industry regarding potential OCI arising from the SASS II acquisition. \n\nThe nature of the work anticipated under the SASS II may create the potential for OCI(s) as currently described in FAR Subpart 9.5.  Each interested party should review FAR Subpart 9.5 in light of NASA&rsquo;s anticipation of OCI issues and consider carefully the extent to which an OCI may arise before making the decision to compete for the SASS II.  \n\nSpecifically, NASA anticipates that the effort under the SASS II will include the following types of tasks which could lead to potential OCI issues.  This list is not all inclusive.  \n\n\n\t\n\tThe Contractor may be required to provide technical support to NASA for new systems development for current and future programs/missions. (e.g. Orion, ISS, Gateway, etc.) \n\t\n\t\n\tThe Contractor may be required to inspect, evaluate, access, critique, review, or perform other similar services with respect to products or services provided by the Contractor under other NASA contracts. \n\t\n\t\n\tThis effort may require direct simulation and advance software service functions to the JSC Engineering, Flight Operations, and Human Health Performance Directorates and their contractor developed products. \n\t\n\n\nA link to the NASA&rsquo;s Guide on OCI is listed below: https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/guides/OCI_Guide.pdf \n\nPlease reference this document for additional information about NASA&rsquo;s policies with respect to OCI issues. Interested parties are requested to address the following questions: \n\n1. What type(s) of OCI issues would your company or potential team identify, if any, should you choose to propose on the SASS II contract?  \n\n2. What strategies would you anticipate proposing to mitigate the OCI issues that you identified (if any)?  Please provide strategy details, previous examples/experience with other contracts with NASA or other agencies, etc. \n\n3. Are there any other types of potential OCI issues with the proposed SASS II contract that were not identified in this RFI (assuming any were identified)? \n\n4. Does your company foresee any OCI issues associated with the SASS II that would cause you to decide not to propose on the potential SASS II RFP? \n\nNASA will review any responses received regarding potential OCI and each offeror&rsquo;s proposed OCI mitigation strategy.  NASA will respond to each company who submits a mitigation strategy.  NASA&rsquo;s response is not intended to serve as a confirmation that, in fact, all potential OCI have been identified, an OCI will ultimately exist, or that an interested party is capable of successfully eliminating or mitigating an identified OCI.  NASA&rsquo;s response is also not intended to encourage or discourage any interested party from responding to an RFP issued for SASS II in the future.  Furthermore, NASA&rsquo;s response in no way alters or interprets FAR 9.5 as it applies to a final statement of work or a final proposal submission, should an interest party elect to submit a proposal to an RFP for SASS II.  Subsequent to the initial OCI submission and NASA&rsquo;s response, NASA will not consider further information as it relates to this RFI. \n\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility \n\nIn support of the Executive Order (EO) 13985, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, NASA is seeking to advance equity or remove barriers for members of underserved communities related to this requirement. As defined in the EO, Underserved Communities refers to populations sharing a particular characteristic, as well as geographic communities, that have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic, social, and civic life, as exemplified by the list in the preceding definition of &quot;equity.&quot; Equity means the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. \n\nNASA seeks input in the following areas: \n\n1. To support the requirements identified in this request for information (RFI)/sources sought notification, what barriers or opportunities exist to engage subject matter experts from industry and academia and how can those barriers be overcome? How can underserved communities be leveraged? \n\n2. To support the requirements identified in this RFI, what barriers or opportunities exist to partner with subcontractors that employ members of underserved communities, as defined above? \n\n3. What other recommendations would you make to enhance diversity and inclusion? \n\n4. What should be considered to encourage full participation and contribution of organizations and individuals (e.g., outreach efforts and innovative partnerships) in performance of this requirement? \n\nSubmission Instructions  \n\nInterested parties having the required capabilities necessary to meet the SASS II requirement described herein should submit a capability statement of no more than 7 pages, using no less than 12-point Times New Roman font indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort. The Vendor Capability Matrix will be included within the 7-page limitation. The OCI information should be submitted as an additional document. There is no page limitation to the OCI information submittal. \n\nInterested parties who consider themselves qualified one or more elements of the Statement of Work are invited to submit a response to this Sources Sought Notice by June 7, 2024. All questions and responses under this Sources Sought Notice must be emailed to Carlos Roman at carlos.roman@nasa.gov and Yushu Mao at yushu.mao@nasa.gov.

To assess the market capacity, the government will review potential offeror&rsquo;s past performance with respect to this type of work; and Experience providing services under a performance-based service acquisition contract. \n\nNASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.  The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at: https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/Procurement-Ombuds-Comp-Advocate-Listing.pdf \n\nOrganizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) \n\nIn addition to the information requested above, NASA is requesting information from industry regarding potential OCI arising from the SASS II acquisition. \n\nThe nature of the work anticipated under the SASS II may create the potential for OCI(s) as currently described in FAR Subpart 9.5.  Each interested party should review FAR Subpart 9.5 in light of NASA&rsquo;s anticipation of OCI issues and consider carefully the extent to which an OCI may arise before making the decision to compete for the SASS II.  \n\nSpecifically, NASA anticipates that the effort under the SASS II will include the following types of tasks which could lead to potential OCI issues.  This list is not all inclusive.  \n\n\n\t\n\tThe Contractor may be required to provide technical support to NASA for new systems development for current and future programs/missions. (e.g. Orion, ISS, Gateway, etc.) \n\t\n\t\n\tThe Contractor may be required to inspect, evaluate, access, critique, review, or perform other similar services with respect to products or services provided by the Contractor under other NASA contracts. \n\t\n\t\n\tThis effort may require direct simulation and advance software service functions to the JSC Engineering, Flight Operations, and Human Health Performance Directorates and their contractor developed products. \n\t\n\n\nA link to the NASA&rsquo;s Guide on OCI is listed below: https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/guides/OCI_Guide.pdf \n\nPlease reference this document for additional information about NASA&rsquo;s policies with respect to OCI issues. Interested parties are requested to address the following questions: \n\n1. What type(s) of OCI issues would your company or potential team identify, if any, should you choose to propose on the SASS II contract?  \n\n2. What strategies would you anticipate proposing to mitigate the OCI issues that you identified (if any)?  Please provide strategy details, previous examples/experience with other contracts with NASA or other agencies, etc. \n\n3. Are there any other types of potential OCI issues with the proposed SASS II contract that were not identified in this RFI (assuming any were identified)? \n\n4. Does your company foresee any OCI issues associated with the SASS II that would cause you to decide not to propose on the potential SASS II RFP? \n\nNASA will review any responses received regarding potential OCI and each offeror&rsquo;s proposed OCI mitigation strategy.  NASA will respond to each company who submits a mitigation strategy.  NASA&rsquo;s response is not intended to serve as a confirmation that, in fact, all potential OCI have been identified, an OCI will ultimately exist, or that an interested party is capable of successfully eliminating or mitigating an identified OCI.  NASA&rsquo;s response is also not intended to encourage or discourage any interested party from responding to an RFP issued for SASS II in the future.  Furthermore, NASA&rsquo;s response in no way alters or interprets FAR 9.5 as it applies to a final statement of work or a final proposal submission, should an interest party elect to submit a proposal to an RFP for SASS II.  Subsequent to the initial OCI submission and NASA&rsquo;s response, NASA will not consider further information as it relates to this RFI. \n\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility \n\nIn support of the Executive Order (EO) 13985, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, NASA is seeking to advance equity or remove barriers for members of underserved communities related to this requirement. As defined in the EO, Underserved Communities refers to populations sharing a particular characteristic, as well as geographic communities, that have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic, social, and civic life, as exemplified by the list in the preceding definition of &quot;equity.&quot; Equity means the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. \n\nNASA seeks input in the following areas: \n\n1. To support the requirements identified in this request for information (RFI)/sources sought notification, what barriers or opportunities exist to engage subject matter experts from industry and academia and how can those barriers be overcome? How can underserved communities be leveraged? \n\n2. To support the requirements identified in this RFI, what barriers or opportunities exist to partner with subcontractors that employ members of underserved communities, as defined above? \n\n3. What other recommendations would you make to enhance diversity and inclusion? \n\n4. What should be considered to encourage full participation and contribution of organizations and individuals (e.g., outreach efforts and innovative partnerships) in performance of this requirement? \n\nSubmission Instructions  \n\nInterested parties having the required capabilities necessary to meet the SASS II requirement described herein should submit a capability statement of no more than 7 pages, using no less than 12-point Times New Roman font indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort.

        "description_text": "NOTES:\n\nCaution:  This market survey is being conducted to identify potential sources that may possess the specialized expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirements to provide repair procedure and Technical Data Package development for B-2 structural and electronic assemblies.  This effort requires a minimum of a SECRET/SAP level of security clearance.  Contractors/Institutions responding to this market research are placed on notice that participation in this survey may not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards.  The Government will not reimburse participants for any expenses associated with their participation in this survey.\n\nThe Air Force is in search of prospective vendors for an engineering services effort regarding the B-2 Data Entry Panel (DEP).  The B-2 Data Entry Panel (DEP) is a flight safety critical unit and primarily functions to provide avionics monitoring and control capabilities to the crew and maintenance personnel.  Multi-function keys, keyboard and CRT display are used for data input and processing.  The unit is designed and hardened for nuclear environment operations.\n\nThe B-2 DEP is a safety of flight critical asset and is in critical need of obsolescence resolution to prevent mission impact.  Obsolescence of the LRU prevents new procurement, so internal obsolescence must be addressed before more spares are purchased.  The purpose of this effort includes the design, build, and qualification of all the necessary support equipment for test and manufacturing of the DEP, as well as update to the Technical Data Package (TDP) to provide unlimited data rights and update Technical Orders to support and enable future procurement and repair of the DEP.  Potential vendors must be capable of performing the following tasks and meet the following requirements:\n\nEvaluation of BOM, all production/test equipment, and documentation\n\n\n\tBased on the list of current and projected obsolescence, the contractor shall identify and evaluate proposed alternatives for long term sustainment. LRU form, fit, and function shall be maintained.\n\tMeet all current B-2 DEP P-Spec requirements.\n\tAddress any verification/validation requirements for implementation of new designs.\n\tDelivery of Flight Justification Test (FJT) or production representative assets to support integration test, validation, and verification activities.\n\tDetermine what parts require further testing to assure feasibility of the proposed solutions.\n\tDevelop and deliver a Technical Data Package.\n\n\nAt this time, Northrop Grumman is the only known source with qualifications to execute this effort.\n\nPrior to release of technical data to prospective vendors, these vendors must first submit their capabilities and past performance to demonstrate the following:\n\n\n\tDefine, plan, implement, and test low observable applications.\n\tDesign, Repair and/or manufacture other related B-2 aircraft LRUs of this nature.\n\tMaintain an AS9110 (or equivalent) quality system.\n\tEmploy only individuals who can pass a Defense Investigative Service background check required for a SECRET clearance and maintain such clearance.\n\tMaintains a corporate cost accounting system that meets the requirements of DCMA and/or DCAA.\n\tMust not be owned (directly or indirectly) by a foreign company(ies) or individual(s) for the duration of any potential Government contract.\n\n\nAs a small or large business, do you believe conditions exist for a small business set-aside in accordance with FAR 19.502-3(a) for any portion of the requirement described above?  If yes, please indicate which portion of the requirement and the most appropriate NAICS code for each portion.  Of the portion of work you identified as having the potential to be small business set-aside, are you most interested in performing as a prime contractor or subcontractor for the requirement described above?  Please indicate whether you would qualify as a small or large business under the NAICS code you believe is most appropriate.\n\nIf you are a small business, of the portion of work you identified as having the potential to be partially set-aside, are you capable of performing at least 50% of the work, in order to comply with FAR Clause 52.219-14, specifically 52.219-14(c)(1), &ldquo;At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.&rdquo;\n\nIf you are a small business interested in performing a portion of the requirement as a set- aside, provide a brief summary of your company&rsquo;s experience and past performance within the past three years as a prime contractor as it relates to the magnitude of this anticipated requirement and/or the portion of the work you identified as having the potential to be partially set-aside.\n\nIf a large business, relative to NAICS Code 541330, submit the reasonable expectation of subcontracting opportunities for small business concern(s) to provide materials, parts and/or services in support of your capabilities to meet the requirements of this effort.\n",
