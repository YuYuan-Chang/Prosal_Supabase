    "description_body": "<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing this Sources Sought Announcement to determine interest, availability, and capability of 8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Woman-Owned, and Small Business concerns to perform the work described below under a Best Value Fixed Price Remedial Action Contract (RAC). The NAICS code for this procurement is 562910 (size standard &lt;1,000 employees). Remediation field work is expected to be performed in 2026, and two rounds of performance monitoring would be completed in 2027. The value of the project is expected to be in the $5M to $10M range.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District desires to identify contractors capable of providing Environmental Remediation Services for the installation of a permeable reactive barrier (PRB), or treatment line, using zero-valent iron (ZVI) to reduce hexavalent chromium (Cr[VI]) to less toxic trivalent chromium in groundwater in the mid-plume area of the site southeast of the Walton &amp; Lonsbury (W&amp;L) property. This work is part of ongoing remediation activities in accordance with the Record of Decision (ROD)(EPA, 2019).</p>\n\n<p>Responses to this Sources Sought announcement will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. After reviewing responses to this announcement, and if the Government still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in the https://sam.gov/ website for the respective project. NO SOLICITATION IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. All interested offerors will have the opportunity to respond to the solicitation announcement later.</p>\n\n<p><strong><u>Project Information</u></strong><strong>:</strong></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>The W&amp;L Superfund Site is a former electroplating facility that operated from 1940 to 2007. Since 2010, several environmental investigation and remediation activities have been performed at the site, including removal of W&amp;L facility buildings and residual waste materials, excavation and disposal of contaminated site media, and installation of an engineered cover behind residences along Paulette Lane and North Avenue to prevent upwelling of chromium-contaminated groundwater to the ground surface and to prevent direct exposure to chromium-contaminated soil. A PRB was constructed on the downgradient edge of the cover, with the goal of using zerovalent iron (ZVI) to reduce hexavalent chromium (Cr[VI]) to the less toxic trivalent chromium in groundwater before it discharges into Bliss Brook southeast of the W&amp;L property.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>The selected remedy for the mid-plume of this project involves installing a minimum 2.5-foot-wide treatment line located along the west side of North Avenue, spanning 209 feet from approximately 80 ft south of PDI-MID-03S to approximately 25 ft north of PDI-MID-04D (see provided site plan) to depths ranging from approximately 25 to 35 feet below ground surface, keyed into the underlying till. The reactive medium is a 63% ZVI/37% sand mixture by weight on average. Bench and Pilot Tests performed by HGL environmental consultants have ruled out injection delivery methods. The USACE is open to other construction means and methods, but consideration must be given to the physical constraints at the site, including a limited working area between a busy road, overhead utility lines, and a wetland (see provided site plan). Management of contaminated saturated soil may be required. A temporary access road would need to be constructed across an existing wetland to facilitate construction of the treatment line. Note that minimizing the road footprint may allow the possibility of leaving the road after treatment line construction if flood storage compensation is maintained and wetland impacts can be mitigated through value enhancements and/or replication elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Other work expected to be included with this contract:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Preparation of work plans, including but not limited to:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Work Plan</li>\n\t\t<li>Air Monitoring Plan</li>\n\t\t<li>Noise and Vibration Monitoring Plan</li>\n\t\t<li>Stormwater Management Plan</li>\n\t\t<li>Waste Management Plan</li>\n\t\t<li>Site Access/Traffic Control Plan</li>\n\t\t<li>Accident Prevention Plan with Health &amp; Safety Plan</li>\n\t\t<li>Construction Quality Control Plan</li>\n\t\t<li>Erosion Control Plan</li>\n\t\t<li>Quality Assurance Project Plan with Sampling and Analysis Plan</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Utility Protection</li>\n\t<li>Tree Clearing</li>\n\t<li>Earthwork</li>\n\t<li>Installation of temporary access road to work site.</li>\n\t<li>Disposal of Contaminated Soil</li>\n\t<li>Installation of groundwater monitoring wells associated with the PRB.</li>\n\t<li>Groundwater monitoring to evaluate the effectiveness of the PRB (Year 2).</li>\n\t<li>Wetland restoration.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>All work will be performed in accordance with CERCLA, the September 2019 W&amp;L Superfund Site ROD, and EPA green and sustainability principles.</p>\n\n<p><strong><u>Responses</u></strong><strong>:</strong></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>In order that we may assess your capability to perform this contract adequately, interested firms should submit a capabilities package to include, at the minimum, the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Firm&rsquo;s name, address, point-of-contact, phone number, email address, CAGE and SAM.gov Unique Entity Identifier.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Business classification (e.g., small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business).</li>\n\t<li>Project overview and description for up to five (5) sample treatment line remediation projects comparable in scale and complexity to the project described above that were completed within the past seven (7) years.

Note that minimizing the road footprint may allow the possibility of leaving the road after treatment line construction if flood storage compensation is maintained and wetland impacts can be mitigated through value enhancements and/or replication elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Other work expected to be included with this contract:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Preparation of work plans, including but not limited to:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Work Plan</li>\n\t\t<li>Air Monitoring Plan</li>\n\t\t<li>Noise and Vibration Monitoring Plan</li>\n\t\t<li>Stormwater Management Plan</li>\n\t\t<li>Waste Management Plan</li>\n\t\t<li>Site Access/Traffic Control Plan</li>\n\t\t<li>Accident Prevention Plan with Health &amp; Safety Plan</li>\n\t\t<li>Construction Quality Control Plan</li>\n\t\t<li>Erosion Control Plan</li>\n\t\t<li>Quality Assurance Project Plan with Sampling and Analysis Plan</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Utility Protection</li>\n\t<li>Tree Clearing</li>\n\t<li>Earthwork</li>\n\t<li>Installation of temporary access road to work site.</li>\n\t<li>Disposal of Contaminated Soil</li>\n\t<li>Installation of groundwater monitoring wells associated with the PRB.</li>\n\t<li>Groundwater monitoring to evaluate the effectiveness of the PRB (Year 2).</li>\n\t<li>Wetland restoration.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>All work will be performed in accordance with CERCLA, the September 2019 W&amp;L Superfund Site ROD, and EPA green and sustainability principles.</p>\n\n<p><strong><u>Responses</u></strong><strong>:</strong></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>In order that we may assess your capability to perform this contract adequately, interested firms should submit a capabilities package to include, at the minimum, the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Firm&rsquo;s name, address, point-of-contact, phone number, email address, CAGE and SAM.gov Unique Entity Identifier.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Business classification (e.g., small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business).</li>\n\t<li>Project overview and description for up to five (5) sample treatment line remediation projects comparable in scale and complexity to the project described above that were completed within the past seven (7) years.

    "description_body": "<p><strong>1. &nbsp;CONTRACT INFORMATION:</strong> &nbsp;Architect-Engineer (A-E) services procured in accordance with PL 92-582 (Brooks A-E Act) and FAR Part 36, are required for various military and civil works projects within the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Honolulu District (POH) Area of Responsibility (AOR). &nbsp;The POH AOR includes State of Hawaii, territories of Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), Federal States of Micronesia (FSM), American Samoa, and Kwajalein Atoll, and Republic of the Marshall Islands.</p>\n\n<p>Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDCs) will be negotiated and awarded with a base period of five (5) years with an option to extend services for six (6) months. It is the Government&rsquo;s intent to award at least three small business (SB) A_E IDCs with a not-to-exceed shared capacity of $9,900,000. The Government obligates itself to obtain no less than $1,000.00 in services.&nbsp;The criteria set forth in FAR 36.602-1 will be utilized for the selection of A-E firms rather than competitive bidding procedures, with the contracts anticipated to be awarded in November 2025. Labor and Overhead rates will be negotiated for each 12-month period of the contract.</p>\n\n<p>After contracts are awarded, work will be issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price task orders. Task order selection procedures will be in accordance with applicable regulations.&nbsp; When the Government awards a task order under this MATOC, the Contracting Officer will notify all A-E firms within the MATOC pool of the task order requirement. The Task Order Requirement Notice (TORN) will include a short summary of the scope of work, selection criteria, and may include a request for supplemental information tailored to the specific task order requirement. Alternatively, the Government may feel that they have enough information to make the selection, in which case, no request for supplemental information will be made. Using the selection criteria specified in the TORN, the selection board will evaluate the SF-330s on file and responses to the Task Order Questionnaire to determine the most highly qualified firm for the specific task order requirement. The board will submit a report to the Selection Board Authority who will then make the selection in accordance with AFARS 5136.602-4 and 5136.602-5 and USACE implementation guidance.</p>\n\n<p>Each A-E firm selected under this announcement will be asked if they would like to update their SF330s on an annual basis in accordance with FAR 36.603(d).</p>\n\n<p>To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered with the System for Award Management (SAM) database. For instruction on registering with SAM see the SAM website at https://www.sam.gov/.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. </strong>&nbsp;<strong>PROJECT INFORMATION:</strong> &nbsp;Work primarily includes, but is not limited to, geotechnical engineering, land surveying, environmental engineering, cost estimating, and specification writing. This includes design and engineering services for structure foundations, sub-grades for roadways, embankments, dams, and soil erosion control. Land surveying work includes cadastral and land parcel mapping; topographic mapping; control surveys; and digital terrain modeling. Aerial photography, LiDAR, and hydrographic surveys may also be required. Specific computer-aided drafting (CAD) equipment, format of CAD products, and compliance with A/E/C standards will be required. Metric system will be a requirement on selected projects.</p>\n\n<p>The Prime contractor must have capability in either geotechnical engineering or land surveying. &nbsp;Collectively as a team, the prime contractor and/or its sub-consultants must have capability in the following disciplines:</p>\n\n<p>Geotechnical Engineering<br />\nEngineering Geology<br />\nTopographic Surveying<br />\nAerial (Photography/LiDAR) Surveying<br />\nOrthophotography / Photogrammetry<br />\nCadastral Mapping<br />\nLand Parcel Mapping<br />\nHydrographic Surveying<br />\nEnvironmental Engineering<br />\nCivil Engineering<br />\nCost Engineering<br />\n<br />\n<strong>3.</strong> &nbsp;<strong>SELECTION CRITERIA: </strong>&nbsp;The primary selection criteria are listed in descending order of importance. Criteria &ldquo;a.&rdquo; through &ldquo;e.&rdquo; are considered primary. Criteria &ldquo;f.&rdquo; through &ldquo;g.&rdquo; are considered secondary and will only be used as tiebreakers among highly qualified firms that are ranked technically equal using the primary criteria. Content provided by the Offeror beyond the stated maximums will not be evaluated.</p>\n\n<p><u>a.&nbsp;Specialized Experience and Technical Qualifications:</u></p>\n\n<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp; The evaluation will consider the extent of the firm&rsquo;s experience of the prime firm and sub-consultants for the services described in paragraph 2 &quot;Project Information.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>SF330 requirement(s): &nbsp;A maximum of five (5) example projects may be submitted for consideration under SF330, Part I, Section F. &nbsp;Example projects shall be 100% completed projects within seven (7) years of the pre-solicitation closing date specified in Paragraph 5. &nbsp;Incomplete projects will not be evaluated. &nbsp;All projects shall clearly state the start and completion dates as well a clear project scope.&nbsp; The offeror shall specifically identify the approximate amount of work, as a percentage (%) of the total value, contributed by the prime and each sub-consultant.&nbsp; Additional information demonstrating a firm&#39;s qualifications may be presented under SF330, Part I, Section H (Additional Information).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>(2) &nbsp; &nbsp;Experience. Demonstrate experience in accomplishing relevant projects as described in section 2 (Project Information) of this solicitation. Projects of greater relevance/scope/complexity and requiring participation of multiple disciplines, including sub-consultants, will be evaluated more favorably. Demonstration of prior working relationships between the prime and sub-consultants, with direct involvement of the prime firm on example projects, will be evaluated more favorably. &nbsp;The basis of evaluation will be the example project(s) presented in SF330, Part I, Section F.</p>\n\n<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Management Plan/Structure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide specific details on management plan and organizational structure along with how task orders will be managed to meet project milestones, within SF330, Part I, Section H (Additional Information).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Quality Management. &nbsp;Clearly describe the firm&rsquo;s quality control procedures and the firm&rsquo;s approach to resolve issues of quality, and ensure technical quality and accuracy of work products.

Professional qualifications:</u></p>\n\n<p>The evaluation will consider the education, training, registration and overall relevant experience of the firm&#39;s key personnel.</p>\n\n<p>Provide a minimum of one (1) individual / up to a maximum of two (2) individuals per discipline for each of the key personnel disciplines identified below.&nbsp; Identified key personnel will be more highly evaluated if the individual demonstrates longevity with the firm and participated in the example projects submitted in SF 330 Section F. &nbsp;Use a separate Section E for each key personnel. &nbsp;Do not generalize professional registrations or certifications, rather provide specific details. All architect/engineer disciplines must be registered in the appropriate professional field. For the purposes of this selection criteria, the use of the term &quot;registered&quot; is defined as a Registered Architect or Professional Engineer registered to practice in the particular discipline in a State, the District of Columbia, or an outlying area of the United States. The government will evaluate, as appropriate, the registration, education, certifications, overall and relevant project experience, and longevity with the firm. Provide Section G Key Personnel Participation In Example Projects.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This criterion focuses on the qualifications of the key personnel for the contract and not the quantity of personnel, which is addressed under the &quot;capacity to accomplish the work&quot; criterion.</p>\n\n<p>Provide key personnel resumes for the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>U.S. REGISTERED GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEER</li>\n\t<li>U.S. REGISTERED ENGINEERING GEOLOGIST</li>\n\t<li>U.S. REGISTERED SURVEYOR. &nbsp;Licensed Professional Land Surveyor (LPLS)</li>\n\t<li>AERIAL (PHOTOGRAPHY/LIDAR) SURVEYOR</li>\n\t<li>ORTHOPHOTOGRAPHY/PHOTOGRAMMETRY</li>\n\t<li>CADASTRAL MAPPING</li>\n\t<li>LAND PARCEL MAPPING</li>\n\t<li>HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYING</li>\n\t<li>U.S. REGISTERED CIVIL ENGINEER</li>\n\t<li>U.S. REGISTERED ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEER</li>\n\t<li>COST ENGINEER (At least ten (10) years cost estimating experience and be a Certified Estimating Professional (CEP), Certified Cost Consultant (CCC) or Certified Cost Professional (CCP) as certified by the AACE or Certified Professional Construction Estimator (CPCE) from the Professional Construction Estimators Association of America. Demonstrate experience in use of MII software)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><u>c.&nbsp;Knowledge of Locality:</u></p>\n\n<p>Firms will be evaluated on specific familiarity with the site conditions in Hawaii and other areas of the USACE Pacific Ocean Honolulu (POH) Area of Responsibility (AOR).</p>\n\n<p>Knowledge of the local conditions, including physical environment, local and applicable engineering criteria/codes/processes of local city/county/state/federal jurisdictions/authorities, and construction market conditions and methods will be evaluated. &nbsp;Key personnel resumes shall demonstrate their knowledge of locality. &nbsp;Provide specific information on both the prime firm&rsquo;s / joint venture&rsquo;s (JV) and sub-consultants&rsquo; local experience and knowledge. &nbsp;The prime firm&rsquo;s or JV&rsquo;s knowledge of locality will be evaluated more favorably than sub-consultants. &nbsp;Example projects performed within the USACE POH AOR will have greater weight than those performed outside the USACE POH AOR.&nbsp; The basis of evaluation for this criterion will focus on the information provided in SF330, Part I, Section E (Resume of Key Personnel), Section F (Example Projects), and H (Additional Information).</p>\n\n<p>Although the firm&rsquo;s geographic proximity in relation to the location of the work will be considered, the firm&rsquo;s longevity and experience within the geographic proximity is of higher value.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><u>d.&nbsp;Past Performance:</u></p>\n\n<p>The evaluation will consider all past performance of the prime A-E contractor as documented in the Government&#39;s Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) managed through the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS). Firms will be evaluated on past performance on schedule, cost, and management. Performance evaluations for the prime firm is considered the most relevant criteria; however, past performance for any significant subconsultants may also be considered. Performance evaluations on completed projects within seven (7) years of solicitation closing date and/or SF 330 Section F example projects is also considered more relevant.</p>\n\n<p>Any credible, documented information on past performance may be submitted, but the government is not required to seek other information on past performance if none is available through PPIRS. An offeror may use Past Performance Questionnaires (PPQ) to provide or supplement a firm&#39;s past performance. Firms choosing to use the PPQ may obtain a PPQ standard form by submitting a request to POCs indicated in this solicitation.</p>\n\n<p><u>e. Capacity to accomplish the work: &nbsp;</u></p>\n\n<p>Provide a narrative discussing the Offeror&rsquo;s capacity to perform at least two (2) simultaneous task orders, and capacity to take on unanticipated additional work, accomplished within the Government&#39;s required schedule. Information shall be provided in SF330, Part I, Section H (Additional Information). Also considered are the number of employees listed in Part II General Qualifications.&nbsp;Provide a Part II form for each prime, JV, and sub-consultant.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>SECONDARY selection criteria, to be used as &ldquo;tie-breakers&rdquo; among technically equal firms, are listed in descending order of importance as follows:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><u>f.&nbsp;Volume of recent DoD contract awards: &nbsp;</u></p>\n\n<p>Provide a complete listing of all work awarded to the Offeror within the previous twelve (12) months of this solicitation&rsquo;s closing date. &nbsp;When identifying the total volume of work, include all stand-alone or indefinite delivery contract (IDC) task orders, including modifications, issued by DoD agencies. &nbsp;For IDCs, include total value of task orders actually issued by agencies in the last 12 months.&nbsp; DO NOT include the potential value of an IDC, nor options which have not been exercised. &nbsp;For all types of contracts, do not include for consideration options that have not been exercised. Present information for this criterion in SF330, Part I, Section H (Additional Information).</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. BASIS FOR ADJECTIVAL EVALUATION:&nbsp; </strong>An adjectival rating scale will be applied to each selection criteria with the highest possible rating first and in descending order: Excellent, Highly Acceptable, Acceptable, Marginal, Unacceptable.</p>\n\n<p><u>Excellent (E):</u> The proposal is outstanding in that it clearly demonstrates a thorough understanding of the requirements and greatly exceeds the minimum level for the criterion. The Offeror&rsquo;s capabilities are of the highest proficiency and are thoroughly illustrated or substantiated. The proposal is internally consistent throughout when addressing the criterion. The proposal has significant strengths in exceeding the minimum level of the criterion and contains no weaknesses or deficiencies.</p>\n\n<p><u>Highly Acceptable (HA):</u> The proposal is very good, demonstrates good understanding of requirements, and exceeds the minimum level for the criterion. The Offeror&rsquo;s capabilities are of high proficiency and are well justified or substantiated. The proposal contains very minor or no inconsistencies with other portions of the proposal when addressing the criterion. The proposal has strengths in exceeding the minimum level for the criterion and is not significantly offset by weaknesses and contains no deficiencies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><u>Acceptable (A):</u> The proposal is acceptable in that it meets the minimum level for the criterion. The proposal demonstrates an acceptable level of understanding of requirements. The Offeror&rsquo;s capabilities are of an acceptable level of competency and are sufficiently illustrated or substantiated. The proposal contains minor or no inconsistencies or incompatibilities with other portions of the proposal when addressing the criterion. The proposal has strengths in meeting the minimum level for the criterion and is not significantly offset by weaknesses and/or deficiencies.</p>\n\n<p><u>Marginal (M):</u> The proposal does not meet the minimum level for the criterion and does not demonstrate an acceptable level of understanding the requirements. The proposal is weak in providing sufficient evidence to demonstrate or illustrate its qualifications or capabilities to perform the anticipated work at an acceptable level of quality. The proposal contains inconsistencies in addressing the criterion. The proposal may have strengths in meeting a portion of the criterion; however, it is offset by weaknesses and/or deficiencies.</p>\n\n<p><u>Unacceptable (U):</u> The proposal is incomplete in that it does not satisfactorily meet the minimum level for this criterion. There is little to no evidence to illustrate that the firm understands the government&rsquo;s minimum requirements. The proposal lacks evidence to demonstrate or illustrate its capabilities to perform the anticipated work. The proposal may have strengths in meeting a portion of the criterion; however, it is completely offset by various inconsistencies, weaknesses, and deficiencies.</p>\n\n<p><u>Only applies to Past Performance Acceptable (A)</u>:&nbsp; The Offeror lacks past performance information in the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). The intent of this rating is not to penalize the Offeror for no past performance as a Prime A-E firm. Therefore, the Government will deem the Offeror to have an &ldquo;Unknown&rdquo; past performance. In the context of acceptability / unacceptability for past performance, &ldquo;Unknown&rdquo; shall be considered &ldquo;Acceptable.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><strong>5.

It is the Government&rsquo;s intent to award at least three small business (SB) A_E IDCs with a not-to-exceed shared capacity of $9,900,000. The Government obligates itself to obtain no less than $1,000.00 in services.&nbsp;The criteria set forth in FAR 36.602-1 will be utilized for the selection of A-E firms rather than competitive bidding procedures, with the contracts anticipated to be awarded in November 2025. Labor and Overhead rates will be negotiated for each 12-month period of the contract.</p>\n\n<p>After contracts are awarded, work will be issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price task orders. Task order selection procedures will be in accordance with applicable regulations.&nbsp; When the Government awards a task order under this MATOC, the Contracting Officer will notify all A-E firms within the MATOC pool of the task order requirement. The Task Order Requirement Notice (TORN) will include a short summary of the scope of work, selection criteria, and may include a request for supplemental information tailored to the specific task order requirement. Alternatively, the Government may feel that they have enough information to make the selection, in which case, no request for supplemental information will be made. Using the selection criteria specified in the TORN, the selection board will evaluate the SF-330s on file and responses to the Task Order Questionnaire to determine the most highly qualified firm for the specific task order requirement. The board will submit a report to the Selection Board Authority who will then make the selection in accordance with AFARS 5136.602-4 and 5136.602-5 and USACE implementation guidance.</p>\n\n<p>Each A-E firm selected under this announcement will be asked if they would like to update their SF330s on an annual basis in accordance with FAR 36.603(d).</p>\n\n<p>To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered with the System for Award Management (SAM) database. For instruction on registering with SAM see the SAM website at https://www.sam.gov/.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. </strong>&nbsp;<strong>PROJECT INFORMATION:</strong> &nbsp;Work primarily includes, but is not limited to, geotechnical engineering, land surveying, environmental engineering, cost estimating, and specification writing.

All architect/engineer disciplines must be registered in the appropriate professional field. For the purposes of this selection criteria, the use of the term &quot;registered&quot; is defined as a Registered Architect or Professional Engineer registered to practice in the particular discipline in a State, the District of Columbia, or an outlying area of the United States. The government will evaluate, as appropriate, the registration, education, certifications, overall and relevant project experience, and longevity with the firm. Provide Section G Key Personnel Participation In Example Projects.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This criterion focuses on the qualifications of the key personnel for the contract and not the quantity of personnel, which is addressed under the &quot;capacity to accomplish the work&quot; criterion.</p>\n\n<p>Provide key personnel resumes for the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>U.S. REGISTERED GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEER</li>\n\t<li>U.S. REGISTERED ENGINEERING GEOLOGIST</li>\n\t<li>U.S. REGISTERED SURVEYOR. &nbsp;Licensed Professional Land Surveyor (LPLS)</li>\n\t<li>AERIAL (PHOTOGRAPHY/LIDAR) SURVEYOR</li>\n\t<li>ORTHOPHOTOGRAPHY/PHOTOGRAMMETRY</li>\n\t<li>CADASTRAL MAPPING</li>\n\t<li>LAND PARCEL MAPPING</li>\n\t<li>HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYING</li>\n\t<li>U.S. REGISTERED CIVIL ENGINEER</li>\n\t<li>U.S. REGISTERED ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEER</li>\n\t<li>COST ENGINEER (At least ten (10) years cost estimating experience and be a Certified Estimating Professional (CEP), Certified Cost Consultant (CCC) or Certified Cost Professional (CCP) as certified by the AACE or Certified Professional Construction Estimator (CPCE) from the Professional Construction Estimators Association of America.

Also considered are the number of employees listed in Part II General Qualifications.&nbsp;Provide a Part II form for each prime, JV, and sub-consultant.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>SECONDARY selection criteria, to be used as &ldquo;tie-breakers&rdquo; among technically equal firms, are listed in descending order of importance as follows:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><u>f.&nbsp;Volume of recent DoD contract awards: &nbsp;</u></p>\n\n<p>Provide a complete listing of all work awarded to the Offeror within the previous twelve (12) months of this solicitation&rsquo;s closing date. &nbsp;When identifying the total volume of work, include all stand-alone or indefinite delivery contract (IDC) task orders, including modifications, issued by DoD agencies. &nbsp;For IDCs, include total value of task orders actually issued by agencies in the last 12 months.&nbsp; DO NOT include the potential value of an IDC, nor options which have not been exercised. &nbsp;For all types of contracts, do not include for consideration options that have not been exercised. Present information for this criterion in SF330, Part I, Section H (Additional Information).</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. BASIS FOR ADJECTIVAL EVALUATION:&nbsp; </strong>An adjectival rating scale will be applied to each selection criteria with the highest possible rating first and in descending order: Excellent, Highly Acceptable, Acceptable, Marginal, Unacceptable.</p>\n\n<p><u>Excellent (E):</u> The proposal is outstanding in that it clearly demonstrates a thorough understanding of the requirements and greatly exceeds the minimum level for the criterion. The Offeror&rsquo;s capabilities are of the highest proficiency and are thoroughly illustrated or substantiated. The proposal is internally consistent throughout when addressing the criterion. The proposal has significant strengths in exceeding the minimum level of the criterion and contains no weaknesses or deficiencies.</p>\n\n<p><u>Highly Acceptable (HA):</u> The proposal is very good, demonstrates good understanding of requirements, and exceeds the minimum level for the criterion. The Offeror&rsquo;s capabilities are of high proficiency and are well justified or substantiated. The proposal contains very minor or no inconsistencies with other portions of the proposal when addressing the criterion. The proposal has strengths in exceeding the minimum level for the criterion and is not significantly offset by weaknesses and contains no deficiencies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><u>Acceptable (A):</u> The proposal is acceptable in that it meets the minimum level for the criterion. The proposal demonstrates an acceptable level of understanding of requirements. The Offeror&rsquo;s capabilities are of an acceptable level of competency and are sufficiently illustrated or substantiated. The proposal contains minor or no inconsistencies or incompatibilities with other portions of the proposal when addressing the criterion. The proposal has strengths in meeting the minimum level for the criterion and is not significantly offset by weaknesses and/or deficiencies.</p>\n\n<p><u>Marginal (M):</u> The proposal does not meet the minimum level for the criterion and does not demonstrate an acceptable level of understanding the requirements. The proposal is weak in providing sufficient evidence to demonstrate or illustrate its qualifications or capabilities to perform the anticipated work at an acceptable level of quality. The proposal contains inconsistencies in addressing the criterion. The proposal may have strengths in meeting a portion of the criterion; however, it is offset by weaknesses and/or deficiencies.</p>\n\n<p><u>Unacceptable (U):</u> The proposal is incomplete in that it does not satisfactorily meet the minimum level for this criterion. There is little to no evidence to illustrate that the firm understands the government&rsquo;s minimum requirements. The proposal lacks evidence to demonstrate or illustrate its capabilities to perform the anticipated work. The proposal may have strengths in meeting a portion of the criterion; however, it is completely offset by various inconsistencies, weaknesses, and deficiencies.</p>\n\n<p><u>Only applies to Past Performance Acceptable (A)</u>:&nbsp; The Offeror lacks past performance information in the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). The intent of this rating is not to penalize the Offeror for no past performance as a Prime A-E firm. Therefore, the Government will deem the Offeror to have an &ldquo;Unknown&rdquo; past performance. In the context of acceptability / unacceptability for past performance, &ldquo;Unknown&rdquo; shall be considered &ldquo;Acceptable.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><strong>5.

    "description_body": "<p>The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Sacramento District (SPK) anticipates solicitation of a requirement for design-bid-build (DBB) construction services to be performed in support of the Pioneer Bridge Levee Improvements at Sacramento, California<em>. </em></p>\n\n<p>The project is anticipated to reduce the risk of levee failure from an erosion related levee breach for approximately 1,000 feet along the Sacramento River. The project is anticipated to include several erosion protection measures located above and below the average low flow water surface elevation (~7 feet NAVD88 as defined) using rock bank protection to include a 3.5-foot-thick lens of launchable Graded Stone C below the water surface to protect the bank from scour and erosion as well as Graded Stone C extended above the water surface to the top of the bank under the Pioneer Bridge section. The project is anticipated to include a 3.5-foot-thick lens of soil-rock mix above the water surface to protect the bank from wave wash generated by boat wakes and wind waves, demolition and removal of the existing upper bank material under the I-80 Pioneer Bridge section to provide a suitable foundation for the Graded Stone C, and In-stream Woody Material (IWM) to be placed below the water line to create in-stream cover for fisheries throughout the seasons and provide flow deflection along the bank.</p>\n\n<p>The Government anticipates construction work will be performed in the Summer and Fall of 2025 / from June 2025 to October 2025. In-water work may only be performed from 1 July 2025 to 31 October 2025.

    "description_body": "<p>1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: This procurement will be conducted in accordance with Public Law 92-582 (Selection of Architects and Engineers or Brooks Act) as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6. The Government intends to award a target of eight contracts as a result of this announcement. The Government has a target to award four other than small business (OTSB) awards and a goal of four awards to small businesses (SB) with a SB reserve target of 10 awarded task orders. The total capacity of the eight contracts is $83,000,000.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>The eight contracts will be IDIQ contracts for a period of one year from date of award, with options to extend for four additional years, not to exceed a total of five years. The primary purpose of this contract is to provide A-E services for projects located within the geographic area of Civil Works (CW) responsibility of the Jacksonville District (SAJ) of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) on land, and on protected and unprotected water, to include portions of Florida and Georgia (See Exhibit A &ndash; SAJ AOR MAP). The South Atlantic Division (SAD) includes parts of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Puerto Rico, and the Antilles. The primary purpose of this proposed contract is to provide services for projects located within the SAJ AOR. Secondarily, the contract may be used to provide services throughout the SAD AOR. The contractor will have the right to refuse orders for services to be performed outside the SAJ AOR. Only the Offerors considered most highly qualified (MHQ) will be awarded a contract. IDIQ MATOCs will be negotiated and awarded from this solicitation with subsequent work issued by negotiating firm-fixed price (FFP) task orders.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>All Offerors responding to this announcement MUST identify to which category they are submitting. All Offerors must state the words, Small Business, or Other than Small Business after the solicitation number in PART I, A, Block 3 of Standard Form 330. A separate SF 330 MUST be submitted for each category in which the firm wants consideration. No one firm will receive more than one award as a result of this solicitation. Small Business (SB) proposals will be evaluated separately for the purpose of selection. That said, SB proposals will be evaluated concurrently (at the same time as, during the same selection board) with the Unrestricted (UNR) pool. A separate board will not be convened for either SB or UNR selections. SBs may submit to compete for one of the SB Reserve (pool) contracts and SBs may also submit to compete for one of the UNR (pool) contracts. SBs must submit separate SF330s for each pool in which they wish to be considered.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330, which has a small business size standard of $25,500,000 in average annual receipts for its preceding three fiscal years. All interested OTSB A-E Offerors are reminded that the successful firm will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent with small and disadvantaged business concerns in accordance with the provisions of Public Law 95-507 and FAR 19.201(a). If an OTSB (i.e., a large business) is selected for this contract, the firm must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on the part of work it intends to subcontract. Large business Offerors should keep small and small disadvantaged business concerns in mind when considering qualifications of potential subcontractors and ensure each proposed subcontractor socioeconomic status is clearly identified in the submission of qualifications. See FAR part 19.704 for SB subcontracting plan requirements.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>NOTE: Small Business Offerors selected for award must comply with the performance of work requirements as stated in FAR 52.219-6 Notice of Total Small Business, and/or FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. Additionally, Small Business Offerors selected for award must be certified in the System for Award Management (SAM) at the time of submission of a price proposal. This is a requirement for SB concerns eligible under the respective program, which have provided all the required documents to the respective program repository. Large Businesses that are selected for award must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan for that part of the work it intends to subcontract. Large Businesses are required to submit a detailed subcontracting plan during contract negotiations. Offerors must adhere to local legal requirements for conducting business in the State of Florida.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Selection for task order negotiations after contract award: The minimum guarantee for each contract will be $10,000; applicable to the base period only. Each task order will be assessed based on whether the task order is appropriate for SB (from reviewing SF330s on file) and set the acquisition aside for SB if it is appropriate. In the event that it is not appropriate to set the acquisition aside for SB, the acquisition will then be opened to the OTSB. Once the MHQ firm is selected, negotiations will be conducted until a fair and reasonable price is achieved. Awarding four contracts in each category (i.e. SB and OTSB) will ensure fair opportunity is given among each of the firms and will follow CECT-ZA Memorandum, <em>Updated Procedures for the Selection of task orders on A-E IDCs</em>.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>2. PROJECT INFORMATION: This scope for A-E services will include engineering and design services for civil works projects for the planning, design, construction management, monitoring, operation and maintenance of projects including inland flood risk management, aquatic ecosystem restoration, coastal storm risk management, and navigation. Projects/features may include, but are not limited to, dams, levees, dikes, canals, water control structures (e.g. gates), pump stations, bridges, maintenance dredging for navigation and military channels, beach nourishment, dredge material management areas, and coastal hard structures such as jetties, groins, revetments, breakwaters, and seawalls/bulkheads. Services may include, but are not limited to, design reports, engineering studies, data collection and investigations, estimates of construction costs and schedules, calculations/analyses, site planning, construction plans/drawings and technical specifications suitable for use in competitive bidding processes, and other areas of engineering and design required for a complete and useable project.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>3. SELECTION CRITERIA: The selection criteria for this project are listed below in descending order of importance (first by major criterion then by each sub-criterion). Criteria in paragraphs A through F are primary. Criteria in paragraphs G and H are secondary and will only be used as a tiebreaker among Offerors that are essentially technically equal. EP 715-1-7, 29 Feb 2012, <em>Architect-Engineer Contracting in USACE</em>, paragraph 3-8d provides, in pertinent part, that <em>Evaluation Method. A board may use any qualitative method, such as adjectival or color coding, to evaluate and compare the qualifications of the firms relevant to each selection criterion.</em> The board intends to use adjectival ratings in its evaluation of the firms by major and sub-criteria for this procurement. Evaluation of the completeness, accuracy, organization and following of these synopsis/solicitation submission requirement instructions will affect the performance rating of the firm as a record of work quality.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p><strong>A. </strong>\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b<strong>SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL COMPETENCE</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>Offerors must clearly demonstrate experience and competence for engineering and design services through relevant projects completed within the last ten years (measured from the date of this synopsis). Project summaries should document breadth and depth of expertise and technical competence for the following evaluation criteria A.(1) &ndash; A.(4). Additional projects may be included in SF 330 Section H. All projects shall be clearly annotated with applicable A-E firms from the team. Images of work products must be clearly annotated with a specific description of what is being presented, and which firm produced the items depicted in the image.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>A maximum of ten relevant projects of the prime, the subcontractor(s), or both, where relevant engineering work was completed within the past ten years (measured from the date of this synopsis), will be reviewed in PART I, Section F. Of these ten projects, the prime must have performed and completed a minimum of six projects (either as the prime or subcontractor). Joint Venture (JV) submissions shall also provide a minimum of six projects; however, if the JV does not have the minimum projects as a JV Offeror, then the Offeror may supplement with projects performed by the members of the JV in their individual capacities to meet the minimum requirements.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Use no more than two pages per project. A Project is defined as a project performed under a single, stand-alone contract and/or a single task order issued under an existing IDIQ contract(s). If multiple work orders are issued for the same scope of work (i.e. investigations, then preliminary, intermediate, and final design), these can be aggregated into a single project. It shall be noted that an IDIQ contract is not a project. Do not combine multiple task orders unrelated to a stand-alone project to create a single project example. Combining multiple task orders under an IDIQ to create a single project will not be compliant with the solicitation criteria, and it will not be evaluated or considered. The contract number or IDIQ number and individual task order number associated with the project in the title must be included for each of the projects. If the project is not 100% complete, note the current percentage and estimated date when the project will be completed for each contract and/or task order. Include the percentage of work self-performed for each contract and/or task order. If proposing as a JV, include the percentage of work self-performed by each JV member.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li><u>Inland Flood Risk Management</u>: includes but is not limited to, numerical modeling and analysis of surface water and groundwater, geotechnical investigations and analysis, field and laboratory material testing, ability to provide services and deliver products using the Autodesk suite of software, engineering and design support of dams, levees, dikes, canals, water control structures, pump stations and utility systems.

An IDIQ Contract is not considered applicable for this factor. Volume of work shall be demonstrated in a table format and be categorized by contract, task order, project award, completion dates, and dollar amount. Work previously awarded to the firm by DoD will be reviewed with the objective of effecting equitable distribution of contracts among equally qualified Offerors.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>4. ENFORCEABILITY OF PROPOSAL: The proposal must set forth full, accurate, and complete information as required by this announcement. By submission of the offer, the offeror agrees that all items proposed (if applicable e.g., key personnel, subcontractors, etc.) will be used for the duration of the contract and any substitutions shall require prior Contracting Officer approval. The award decision for this contract will be based, in part, on an evaluation of the key personnel and/or subcontractors the Contractor included in its proposal for the positions and/or items of subcontracted work identified in the proposal.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>The Contractor agrees these key personnel and/or subcontractors will be employed as described in its proposal and no substitutes will be employed without the prior written approval of the Contracting Officer. The Contractor further agrees that any proposed substitutes shall meet or exceed the qualifications of the original personnel and/or subcontractors. If the Contractor proposal did not name a subcontractor for an identified item of work, the Contractor will not be allowed to subcontract that item of work without prior approval of the Contracting Officer.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>This is not a request for a price proposal. To avoid a conflict of interest, any contractor proposing as a prime may not have a subcontractor who is also proposing as a prime. This solicitation shall be viewed as one singular solicitation. Therefore, a firm submitting a proposal as a prime contractor may NOT also be listed as a subcontractor in ANY other submitted proposal under this solicitation. This requirement also applies to Offerors submitting as Joint Ventures. In the event a conflict of interest is found, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to deem ineligible for award the proposal submitted by the prime firm who is also a subcontractor under another firm proposal.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>As required by acquisition regulations, interviews to discuss prospective contractors qualifications for the contracts will be conducted only for those Offerors considered most highly qualified after submittal review by the selection board. Interviews will be scheduled after the final selection board has determined the most highly qualified Offerors.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>5. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Offerors meeting the requirements described in this announcement and wishing to be considered must submit their SF 330, Part I, for the proposed combined team (firm or joint venture and all subcontractors), and SF 330, Part II, for the firm or joint venture and each subcontractor electronically to PIEE Solicitation Module at https://piee.eb.mil/ system.

The South Atlantic Division (SAD) includes parts of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Puerto Rico, and the Antilles. The primary purpose of this proposed contract is to provide services for projects located within the SAJ AOR. Secondarily, the contract may be used to provide services throughout the SAD AOR. The contractor will have the right to refuse orders for services to be performed outside the SAJ AOR. Only the Offerors considered most highly qualified (MHQ) will be awarded a contract. IDIQ MATOCs will be negotiated and awarded from this solicitation with subsequent work issued by negotiating firm-fixed price (FFP) task orders.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>All Offerors responding to this announcement MUST identify to which category they are submitting. All Offerors must state the words, Small Business, or Other than Small Business after the solicitation number in PART I, A, Block 3 of Standard Form 330. A separate SF 330 MUST be submitted for each category in which the firm wants consideration. No one firm will receive more than one award as a result of this solicitation. Small Business (SB) proposals will be evaluated separately for the purpose of selection. That said, SB proposals will be evaluated concurrently (at the same time as, during the same selection board) with the Unrestricted (UNR) pool. A separate board will not be convened for either SB or UNR selections. SBs may submit to compete for one of the SB Reserve (pool) contracts and SBs may also submit to compete for one of the UNR (pool) contracts. SBs must submit separate SF330s for each pool in which they wish to be considered.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330, which has a small business size standard of $25,500,000 in average annual receipts for its preceding three fiscal years. All interested OTSB A-E Offerors are reminded that the successful firm will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent with small and disadvantaged business concerns in accordance with the provisions of Public Law 95-507 and FAR 19.201(a). If an OTSB (i.e., a large business) is selected for this contract, the firm must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on the part of work it intends to subcontract. Large business Offerors should keep small and small disadvantaged business concerns in mind when considering qualifications of potential subcontractors and ensure each proposed subcontractor socioeconomic status is clearly identified in the submission of qualifications. See FAR part 19.704 for SB subcontracting plan requirements.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>NOTE: Small Business Offerors selected for award must comply with the performance of work requirements as stated in FAR 52.219-6 Notice of Total Small Business, and/or FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. Additionally, Small Business Offerors selected for award must be certified in the System for Award Management (SAM) at the time of submission of a price proposal. This is a requirement for SB concerns eligible under the respective program, which have provided all the required documents to the respective program repository. Large Businesses that are selected for award must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan for that part of the work it intends to subcontract. Large Businesses are required to submit a detailed subcontracting plan during contract negotiations. Offerors must adhere to local legal requirements for conducting business in the State of Florida.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Selection for task order negotiations after contract award: The minimum guarantee for each contract will be $10,000; applicable to the base period only. Each task order will be assessed based on whether the task order is appropriate for SB (from reviewing SF330s on file) and set the acquisition aside for SB if it is appropriate. In the event that it is not appropriate to set the acquisition aside for SB, the acquisition will then be opened to the OTSB. Once the MHQ firm is selected, negotiations will be conducted until a fair and reasonable price is achieved. Awarding four contracts in each category (i.e. SB and OTSB) will ensure fair opportunity is given among each of the firms and will follow CECT-ZA Memorandum, <em>Updated Procedures for the Selection of task orders on A-E IDCs</em>.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>2. PROJECT INFORMATION: This scope for A-E services will include engineering and design services for civil works projects for the planning, design, construction management, monitoring, operation and maintenance of projects including inland flood risk management, aquatic ecosystem restoration, coastal storm risk management, and navigation. Projects/features may include, but are not limited to, dams, levees, dikes, canals, water control structures (e.g. gates), pump stations, bridges, maintenance dredging for navigation and military channels, beach nourishment, dredge material management areas, and coastal hard structures such as jetties, groins, revetments, breakwaters, and seawalls/bulkheads. Services may include, but are not limited to, design reports, engineering studies, data collection and investigations, estimates of construction costs and schedules, calculations/analyses, site planning, construction plans/drawings and technical specifications suitable for use in competitive bidding processes, and other areas of engineering and design required for a complete and useable project.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>3. SELECTION CRITERIA: The selection criteria for this project are listed below in descending order of importance (first by major criterion then by each sub-criterion). Criteria in paragraphs A through F are primary. Criteria in paragraphs G and H are secondary and will only be used as a tiebreaker among Offerors that are essentially technically equal. EP 715-1-7, 29 Feb 2012, <em>Architect-Engineer Contracting in USACE</em>, paragraph 3-8d provides, in pertinent part, that <em>Evaluation Method. A board may use any qualitative method, such as adjectival or color coding, to evaluate and compare the qualifications of the firms relevant to each selection criterion.</em> The board intends to use adjectival ratings in its evaluation of the firms by major and sub-criteria for this procurement. Evaluation of the completeness, accuracy, organization and following of these synopsis/solicitation submission requirement instructions will affect the performance rating of the firm as a record of work quality.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p><strong>A. </strong>\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b<strong>SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL COMPETENCE</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>Offerors must clearly demonstrate experience and competence for engineering and design services through relevant projects completed within the last ten years (measured from the date of this synopsis). Project summaries should document breadth and depth of expertise and technical competence for the following evaluation criteria A.(1) &ndash; A.(4). Additional projects may be included in SF 330 Section H. All projects shall be clearly annotated with applicable A-E firms from the team. Images of work products must be clearly annotated with a specific description of what is being presented, and which firm produced the items depicted in the image.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>A maximum of ten relevant projects of the prime, the subcontractor(s), or both, where relevant engineering work was completed within the past ten years (measured from the date of this synopsis), will be reviewed in PART I, Section F. Of these ten projects, the prime must have performed and completed a minimum of six projects (either as the prime or subcontractor). Joint Venture (JV) submissions shall also provide a minimum of six projects; however, if the JV does not have the minimum projects as a JV Offeror, then the Offeror may supplement with projects performed by the members of the JV in their individual capacities to meet the minimum requirements.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Use no more than two pages per project. A Project is defined as a project performed under a single, stand-alone contract and/or a single task order issued under an existing IDIQ contract(s). If multiple work orders are issued for the same scope of work (i.e. investigations, then preliminary, intermediate, and final design), these can be aggregated into a single project. It shall be noted that an IDIQ contract is not a project. Do not combine multiple task orders unrelated to a stand-alone project to create a single project example. Combining multiple task orders under an IDIQ to create a single project will not be compliant with the solicitation criteria, and it will not be evaluated or considered. The contract number or IDIQ number and individual task order number associated with the project in the title must be included for each of the projects. If the project is not 100% complete, note the current percentage and estimated date when the project will be completed for each contract and/or task order. Include the percentage of work self-performed for each contract and/or task order. If proposing as a JV, include the percentage of work self-performed by each JV member.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li><u>Inland Flood Risk Management</u>: includes but is not limited to, numerical modeling and analysis of surface water and groundwater, geotechnical investigations and analysis, field and laboratory material testing, ability to provide services and deliver products using the Autodesk suite of software, engineering and design support of dams, levees, dikes, canals, water control structures, pump stations and utility systems.

An IDIQ Contract is not considered applicable for this factor. Volume of work shall be demonstrated in a table format and be categorized by contract, task order, project award, completion dates, and dollar amount. Work previously awarded to the firm by DoD will be reviewed with the objective of effecting equitable distribution of contracts among equally qualified Offerors.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>4. ENFORCEABILITY OF PROPOSAL: The proposal must set forth full, accurate, and complete information as required by this announcement. By submission of the offer, the offeror agrees that all items proposed (if applicable e.g., key personnel, subcontractors, etc.) will be used for the duration of the contract and any substitutions shall require prior Contracting Officer approval. The award decision for this contract will be based, in part, on an evaluation of the key personnel and/or subcontractors the Contractor included in its proposal for the positions and/or items of subcontracted work identified in the proposal.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>The Contractor agrees these key personnel and/or subcontractors will be employed as described in its proposal and no substitutes will be employed without the prior written approval of the Contracting Officer. The Contractor further agrees that any proposed substitutes shall meet or exceed the qualifications of the original personnel and/or subcontractors. If the Contractor proposal did not name a subcontractor for an identified item of work, the Contractor will not be allowed to subcontract that item of work without prior approval of the Contracting Officer.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>This is not a request for a price proposal. To avoid a conflict of interest, any contractor proposing as a prime may not have a subcontractor who is also proposing as a prime. This solicitation shall be viewed as one singular solicitation. Therefore, a firm submitting a proposal as a prime contractor may NOT also be listed as a subcontractor in ANY other submitted proposal under this solicitation. This requirement also applies to Offerors submitting as Joint Ventures. In the event a conflict of interest is found, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to deem ineligible for award the proposal submitted by the prime firm who is also a subcontractor under another firm proposal.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>As required by acquisition regulations, interviews to discuss prospective contractors qualifications for the contracts will be conducted only for those Offerors considered most highly qualified after submittal review by the selection board. Interviews will be scheduled after the final selection board has determined the most highly qualified Offerors.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>5. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Offerors meeting the requirements described in this announcement and wishing to be considered must submit their SF 330, Part I, for the proposed combined team (firm or joint venture and all subcontractors), and SF 330, Part II, for the firm or joint venture and each subcontractor electronically to PIEE Solicitation Module at https://piee.eb.mil/ system. A firm will not be considered if its SF330 Part I is not signed, unless the SF330 Part I is accompanied by a signed cover letter or a current (within 3 years) signed SF330 Part II.

Work will be issued by negotiation of firm-fixed-price task orders. There is no limit on the value of the individual task orders, but the total task orders awards will not exceed the total value of the IDC. Minimum Guarantee amount of $2,500 will apply to the base ordering period only.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541330 (Engineering Services), which has a small business size standard of $15,000,000.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p><strong>(b) Contract Award Procedure.</strong> Eligibility for the IDC award requires registration of the offeror with the System for Award Management (SAM) database. Register via the SAM Internet site at <u>https://www.sam.gov/</u>. NO STATE-LEVEL certifications will be accepted.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Missing even one (1) required element will render the offeror non-responsive and eliminate them from further consideration for this IDC.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p><strong>2.&nbsp; PROJECT INFORMATION:</strong> &nbsp;The award of this IDC will provide Southwestern Division A-E Services to support Value Engineering.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>No specific projects or tasks are identified at this time and therefore funds are not presently available for individual task orders under this solicitation. As projects for A-E Services for Value Engineering are received SWD will utilize this IDC to award task orders. The services performed under this IDC and the individual task orders encompass Value Engineering studies/workshops, conducted by the Value Engineering Contractor (VEC), in accordance with the format developed by the Society of American Value Engineers (S.A.V.E.) International (Information, Function Analysis, Creative, Evaluation, Development, and Presentation). The VE study/workshop purpose is to evaluate available project information (design submittals, cost estimates, 1391s, etc.) in order to apply VE principles to further develop subsequent plans and specifications for individual projects. The study/workshop shall focus on assisting the Project Delivery Team (PDT) in determining the &ldquo;best value&rdquo; for project components and performing a cost comparison for each project. The VEC shall also investigate potential alternatives that will assist the Government&rsquo;s achievement of Sustainability requirements for each project if applicable. The VEC shall produce a VE Report with the following details: &nbsp;executive overview of the study/workshop and study/workshop results, value matrix, VE proposal worksheets and recommendations, and an appendix of all background documents.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>The team must contain at least three (3) Certified Value Specialists (CVS) currently certified by SAVE International. Offerors must have the capability to provide cost advice and complete cost estimates utilizing latest version of MII estimating program in accordance with set design schedules identified in individual scopes of work for each task order. MII software will be provided by the Government with database information purchased by the A-E. Other cost estimating software may be required.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>The Offeror selected will be subject to the requirements of FAR Part 52.219-14.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p><strong>3.&nbsp; SELECTION CRITERIA:</strong> &nbsp;The selection criteria are listed below in descending order of importance (first by major criterion and then by each sub-criterion). Criteria a-e are primary. Criterion f-h are secondary and will only be used to rank the contractors among the most highly qualified firms.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>In this synopsis the term &ldquo;recent&rdquo; means A-E tasks orders or contracts completed within the last five (5) years of the synopsis closing date. Older projects will not be considered.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p><strong>(a) Specialized Experience and Technical Competence.</strong> Ensure that all specialized experience requirements are reflected on appropriate personnel resumes in Section E and example projects in Section F, Part I of the SF 330. For criteria listed below, recent experience of subcontractors may be submitted to demonstrate applicable experience and competence provided the nature and extent of all team arrangements are identified and disclosed. Offerors should describe the nature and extent of prior teaming experience with the proposed subcontractors.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>The firm must demonstrate expertise in the following:</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>(1) Demonstrate the recent experience of both the prime and subcontractors leading/participating in Value Engineering studies/workshops.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>(2) Demonstrate recent experience of both the prime and subcontractors utilizing the S.A.V.E.

When a minimum number of years/experiences is listed, it is within the past five (5) years from the closing date of the synopsis. The following is a list of the key personnel, minimum requirements and the minimum number required for the IDC under this acquisition. These minimum requirements can be met utilizing in-house or consultants/subcontractors. Do not list a subcontractor as your firm&rsquo;s employee, as this will be cause for rejection of the SF330. Additional personnel other than the required will not be evaluated.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Three (3) Facilitator/Certified Value Specialist(s) (CVS),</p>\n\n<p>Three (3) registered Civil Engineer(s),</p>\n\n<p>Three (3) registered Structural Engineer(s),</p>\n\n<p>Three (3) registered Architect(s),</p>\n\n<p>Three (3) registered Electrical Engineer(s),</p>\n\n<p>Three (3) registered Mechanical Engineer(s),</p>\n\n<p>One (1) registered Geotechnical Engineer,</p>\n\n<p>One (1) registered Environmental Engineer,</p>\n\n<p>One (1) LEED Accredited Professional, and</p>\n\n<p>Three (3) certified Cost Estimator(s) with MII experience.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>All personnel shall show five (5) years&rsquo; experience, minimum, in their field of expertise within the recent ten (10) years.
