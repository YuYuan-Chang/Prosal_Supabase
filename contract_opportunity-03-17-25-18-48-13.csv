3.0 Background



3.1 The Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) is the official export credit agency of the United States. EXIM is an independent Executive Branch agency with a mission of supporting American jobs by facilitating the export of U.S. goods and services.



When private sector lenders are unable or unwilling to provide financing, EXIM fills in the gap for American businesses by equipping them with the financing tools necessary to compete for global sales. In doing so, the agency levels the playing field for U.S. goods and services going up against foreign competition in overseas markets, so that American companies can create better-paying American jobs.



Because it is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, EXIM assumes credit and country risks that the private sector is unable or unwilling to accept. The agency&#39;s charter requires that all transactions it authorizes demonstrate a reasonable assurance of repayment; EXIM consistently maintains a low default rate and closely monitors credit and other risks in its portfolio.

INTRODUCTION

Responses to this RFI may be used to formulate final requirements and/or to identify qualified vendors capable of meeting those requirements. The description below outlines preliminary requirements envisioned for a modern executive clemency management application. The information gathered may also be used to formulate acquisition strategies for competitive solicitations.

1.  PURPOSE

PARDON is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes only to seek industry perspectives on technical solutions and any optimal innovative approaches that best meet Information Technology (IT) product and/or service solutions objectives, potential costs and answers to specific questions.  PARDON seeks a strong industry partnership to deliver superior application or solution that support our efforts to modernize our existing case management capabilities.

PARDON intends to efficiently engage industry early in the acquisition planning process and foster innovation IT service solutions. This request will allow PARDON and Industry respondents to collaboratively discuss and co-create solutions in support of advance acquisition planning for market research purposes.  This outreach effort is also meant to encourage a &ldquo;Show Me, Don&rsquo;t Tell Me&rdquo; Demonstration Approach &ndash; allowing Industry the option for sharing evidence-based IT products and/or services solutions applicable to the PARDON-specific requirements outlined in this RFI.

This RFI is to:


	Inform vendors about PARDON&rsquo;s executive clemency management requirements
	Gather feedback and recommendations from industry experts.
	Identify potential solutions and technologies.
	Foster open communication with industry whenever necessary, practicable, and appropriate to encourage competition and partnerships.


2.  BACKGROUND 

The Office of the Pardon Attorney is entrusted with the responsibility of administering the executive clemency process, in accordance with longstanding federal regulations codified at 28 C.F.R. &sect;&sect; 0.35, 0.36, and 1.1 &ndash; 1.11. The Office receives, reviews, and investigates applications for executive clemency and provides advice and recommendations to the President. The Office is led by the Pardon Attorney, a career senior executive, and is supported by approximately 40 attorney and non-attorney staff. The Office is nonpolitical and operates under the general oversight of the Deputy Attorney General. For over 130 years, Presidents have relied on the Office to support the exercise of the constitutional clemency power by providing neutral advice and expertise. The Office also prepares the documents the President signs when granting clemency and notifies applicants when the President has made a decision to grant or deny clemency.  More information about PARDON is available at https://www.justice.gov/pardon.

PARDON&rsquo;s Electronic Clemency Records Database (ECRD) serves as the primary record-keeping repository for presidential clemency applications and clemency related correspondence and records. All documents pertaining to a clemency petition ultimately used by the Department and the President to make a final disposition in each case are housed in ECRD. Information is retrieved using a petitioner&rsquo;s government issued identifiers, such as name and social security number (SSN).   

ECRD is also used to maintain subject matter data collections. Access to subject matter data collections can be restricted to selected PARDON team members.  A modern clemency management system to replace their existing application with a Low Code No Code application which covers a wide range of customer relationship management and case management functionality from simple workflows to updating align with newly revised clemency forms (.pdf and online) with reporting/dashboard requirements.  The solution must maintain existing workflows and provide the following functionality including:

The purpose of this amendment is to post the Astrobee Pre-proposal Conference charts that will presented Friday February 21, 2025 at 10:00am. 

___________________

NASA recognizes that a robust and competitive low-Earth orbit (LEO) economy is vital to continued progress in space. To support NASA&#39;s Strategic Goals and Objective 2.2 to &ldquo;Develop a human spaceflight economy enabled by a commercial market,&quot; NASA is building and executing a targeted strategy for an &ldquo;economy of space commerce&rdquo; in LEO that is sustainable, cost-effective, and safe. The current strategy builds on and applies the lessons learned from over a decade of work and experiences with commercial companies. This activity is part of a continuing effort to establish a more affordable and sustainable future for human spaceflight in LEO and beyond.



This Announcement for Partnership Proposals (AFPP) solicits proposals for the operation, sustaining engineering, and utilization of the Astrobee free-flying robotic system aboard the ISS. These robots provide a capability supporting researchers with technology demonstrations, scientific research, and Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) activities in the unique environment of space. The objective of this initiative is to transition operations and sustaining engineering of this Astrobee robotic technology to a non-NASA entity to manage the system and to continue advancement in private sector utilization of this unique capability for the future development of commercial capabilities in space.

The Astrobee system consists of three cubed-shaped robots, software, spares, and a docking station used for recharging. The robots use electric fans as a propulsion system that allows them to fly freely through the microgravity environment of the station. Cameras and sensors help them to &ldquo;see&rdquo; and navigate their surroundings.  The robots also carry a perching arm that allows them to grasp station handrails in order to conserve energy or to grab and hold items.

Working autonomously or via remote control by astronauts, flight controllers, or researchers on the ground, the robots are designed to complete tasks such as taking inventory, documenting experiments conducted by astronauts with their built-in cameras, or working together to move cargo throughout the station. In addition, the system serves as a research platform that can be outfitted and programmed to carry out experiments in microgravity &ndash; helping to learn more about how robotics can benefit astronauts in space.

The due date for proposal submission is March 21, 2025 at 1:00 pm Central Time. See the &quot;Announcement for Proposals&quot; Solicitation in the Attachments/Links section of this notice.

Description

This is a notice of intent, not a request for a quotation.  A solicitation document will not be issued, and quotations will not be requested.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Purchasing and Contracts, on behalf of the Critical Care Medicine Department (CCMD), intends to award a fixed-price contract on a sole-source basis to Premier Healthcare Solutions, Inc., located at 13024 Ballantyne Corporate Place, Charlotte, North Carolina 28277-2113, for a twelve (12) month base year Healthcare Database License. The period of performance will be from 03/31/2025 to 03/30/2026.

The Critical Care Medicine Department requires the continuation of its current data license and data delivery system, which is used in a variety of research studies. Expanding this work will broaden the scope of research conducted at the NIH Clinical Center. Premier is the only healthcare database of its scale with such extensive geographic coverage. The database will include data from over 100 U.S. hospitals spanning the last six years, covering both inpatient and outpatient encounters, physiological variables, microbiology, susceptibility data, and other data points found in additional databases, such as billing codes for diagnoses and procedures, medication administrations, and lab test results. This database is essential for addressing urgent research questions aimed at improving outcomes for critically ill patients. Ongoing epidemiological studies in critical illness will directly influence patient care. Premier Healthcare Solutions, Inc. is the sole vendor capable of providing the necessary data for the planned research within the CCMD. Several studies are already relying on Premier as the primary data source. To ensure the continuity of research without interruption, it is crucial to maintain the current data license and delivery system.

This acquisition is being conducted using policies unique to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13 &ndash; Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT), contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstance of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.  Contracts awarded using FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6-Competition Requirements.

Interested parties may identify their interest by sending their capability statements in response to this posting. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Comments to this announcement, referencing this posting number, may be submitted to the CC, Office of Purchasing and Contracts, prior to the closing date specified in this announcement, electronically to the attention of Tasha Lowe, Contract Specialist, lowet2@mail.nih.gov by the due date March 24, 2025 and time marked in this notice.

THE NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE IS 236220 AND AVERAGE ANNUAL RECEIPTS OF $45 MILLION OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS.  The contract completion period is anticipated to be 1,286 calendar days.

A sources sought notice (N62742-25-S-1303) for this procurement was posted on 22 August 2024 on the System for Award Management (SAM) website https://www.sam.gov/, and a market survey was conducted that included an assessment of relevant qualifications and capabilities of potentially qualified firms.  As a result of the market research analysis, a determination was made to solicit this procurement on an unrestricted basis inviting full and open competition.  The NAVFAC Pacific small business office concurs with this decision.

This is an LPTA source selection procurement. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with Offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306 (a)). Therefore, the initial proposal shall conform to the solicitation requirements and should contain the best offer from a technical and price standpoint based on the following factors: Factor 1 &ndash; Experience, Factor 2 &ndash; Past performance, and Factor 3 &ndash; Safety.  Proposals submitted in response to this solicitation shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars.

Only the three (3) lowest-priced proposals will be evaluated for fair and reasonable pricing and technical acceptability. If none of the three (3) lowest-priced proposals are found to be technically acceptable, then the next three (3) lowest-priced proposals will be evaluated for technical acceptability. If none of the six (6) lowest priced proposals are found to be technically acceptable, then all remaining proposals will be evaluated for technical acceptability.

The Government intends to select the lowest reasonably priced technically acceptable offer and award a contract (within the funds available) without conducting discussions.

A relevant construction project is defined as a construction project that includes at least one of the following individual features:

Precision Cooling System.  New construction of a chiller type technology cooling system engineered specifically for data center/electronic/IT networking environments.  Projects submitted which reference comfort cooling systems which are engineered primarily for the intermittent use required to maintain a comfortable environment for people in facilities will not be considered.  Projects submitted to demonstrate Precision Cooling System will only be considered if the work was performed by the specific entity proposed for the Precision Cooling System under the resultant contract, as identified in Block 1 of Attachment A.

Uninterruptable Power Supply System.  New construction of an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) system that is 225 kVA size or more.  Projects submitted to demonstrate UPS System experience will only be considered if the work was performed by the specific entity proposed for the UPS System, as identified in Block 1 of Attachment A. 

Clean Agent Fire Suppression System.  New construction or replacement of a clean agent fire extinguishing system and releasing system, including all mechanical, controls and electrical components necessary for a complete and operating clean agent fire suppression system.  Projects submitted to demonstrate Clean Agent Fire Suppression System experience will only be considered if the work was performed by the specific entity proposed for the Clean Agent Fire Suppression System, as identified in Block 1 of Attachment A.

1.    Projects submitted to demonstrate relevant construction individual features (1) Precision Cooling System, (2) Uninterruptable Power Supply System, and (3) Clean Agent Fire Suppression System, will only be considered if the work was performed by the specific entity proposed to perform that type of work in this contract.

2.    If the Offeror self-performed the relevant construction individual features (1) Precision Cooling System, (2) Uninterruptable Power Supply System, and (3) Clean Agent Fire Suppression System, then the Offeror must confirm that it will self-perform the same relevant individual feature(s) in order to be considered. If offeror does not intend to self-perform, see note 9 about teaming arrangements.

3.    Projects submitted shall collectively demonstrate experience in all three (3) individual features:  (1) Precision Cooling System, (2) Uninterruptable Power Supply System, and (3) Clean Agent Fire Suppression System.  Failure to demonstrate experience in all three (3) individual features shall be considered a deficiency and an Unacceptable rating will be assigned for this factor.  All individual features, or multiple individual features, do not have to be within any single project scope.

4.    Relevant projects shall have been completed or substantially completed within the last ten (10) years of the date of issuance of the RFP. &ldquo;Substantially complete&rdquo; is defined as at least 90% physically completed construction.

5.    Building alteration, repair, renovation, conversion, and addition work will not be considered as relevant projects.

6.     A relevant construction project is further defined as a construction project performed under a single task order or contract.  For multiple award and indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity type contracts, the contract as a whole shall not be submitted as a project; rather offerors shall submit the work performed under a task order as a distinct project.  For example, multiple task orders under a multiple award and indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity type contracts that demonstrate experience in one or more of the desired individual features describe above shall be submitted as a distinct project, rather than submitting all task orders under a multiple award and indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity type contracts as a single project.

There are two volumes of specifications and drawings issued for this RFP. Volume 1 for the construction of the entire facility, and Volume 2 is for the construction of a secure space within the facility. Consequently, the Volume 2 specifications and drawings are marked &ldquo;CONTROLLED UNCLASSIFIED INFORMATION&rdquo; and will only be released to the U.S. Citizens of U.S. firms.

Volume 2 will only be released as an amendment to U.S. Citizens of a U.S. Firm attachment (1). All contractor personnel handling and accessing the Volume 2 documents must be vetted as a U.S. Citizen prior to receiving any Volume 2 documents.  To determine eligibility for receipt of Volume 2 RFP documents, each interested firm shall complete and submit a U.S. Firm Certification, attachment (1).  All sources, whether prime Offerors or subcontractors at all tiers, must certify that it is a U.S. Firm.  Once a favorable U.S. Firm determination has been made, all individuals of the approved U.S. Firm requiring access to the RFP documents shall complete and submit:

     (1)  Certification of U.S. Citizen (attachment 2)

     (2)  Proof U.S. Citizenship

b130f6972dbd4eb1b38384b3aab92c50,HT9425-25-RFI-TJB-01,Assessment of African Green Monkeys as a Large Animal Model for Hantavirus Infections,"Summary: This RFI/SS is issued solely for information and planning purposes and shall not be construed as a solicitation, restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, or serve as an obligation on the part of the Government. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are advised that the United States Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI/SS will be solely at the interested responder&rsquo;s expense. Not responding to this RFI/SS does not preclude participation in any future Request for Proposal, if any is issued. No evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to Responders responding to this RFI/SS.

The information resulting from this RFI/SS will determine interest and capabilities available in the marketplace; and will assist in developing acquisition strategy.

Background/Scope: The United States Air Force 59th Medical Wing, Science and Technology Office has a requirement for research and development services to establish the African Green Monkey (AGM) as a viable animal model for studying orthohantavirus infection to allow for a thorough understanding of the disease pathogenesis as well as serving as a model to assess potential therapeutics.

Orthohantaviruses are emerging pathogens whose high mortality rates make them a potential biosecurity threat. These ribonucleic acid viruses are predominantly transmitted to humans via rodent hosts and primarily infect microvascular endothelial cells and have the capability to cause viral hemorrhagic fevers, including Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome and Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome. There are no current vaccines or therapeutics to prevent these viruses, primarily due to the lack of a reliable animal model. The African Green Monkey (AGM) has been a cornerstone in virological research due to its comparable immune response to humans.

How to Respond: 

Please submit a Capability Statement that describes relevant experience, expertise, and capabilities based upon the size and scope of this requirement as outlined in the Background/Scope section. 

Each response should include the following business information and must not be more than ten (10) pages in length:

Organization: USACE Rock Island District (CEMVR)

Project Name Southwest Coastal Louisiana Nonstructural Coastal Storm Risk Management Project &ndash; Design Build Remaining Structures MATOC

Contract Type: Firm-Fixed Price Task Orders under an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity, Multiple Award Contract

Contract Duration: Five-year base and one option year (six years)

Set aside: 100% Set aside for Small Business

Product Service Code: YQ1A CONSTRUCTION OF RESTORATION OF REAL PROPERTY (PUBLIC OR PRIVATE)

NAICS Code: 237990 - OTHER HEAVY AND CIVIL ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION

Size Standard: The size standard for this NAICS code is $45,000,000.

Draft RFP: Anticipated in Spring 2025



Experience sought: Experience with design-build construction project experience with Government or Private Sector customers.

Additional Experience (not required): elevation of properties for storm risk management. See Project purpose and description.



Project Purpose: The purpose of this acquisition is to establish a maximum of five contractors under a Regional Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity Multiple-Award Task Order Contract (IDIQ MATOC) with a total shared capacity not to exceed (NTE) $793 million to meet the construction requirements of designing plans for and constructing floodproofing on up to 3,961 individual properties in the Southwest Coastal Louisiana Nonstructural Storm Risk Management Project (Project).



Description: The Project aims to provide hurricane and storm damage risk management in the southwest portion of the state. Given the area&rsquo;s low elevation, flat terrain, and proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, Southwest Louisiana is at high risk of flooding from tidal surge and waves from hurricanes. Additionally, land subsidence, combined with sea-level rise, is expected to increase future potential for coastal flooding. The Project has nonstructural storm damage risk management measures in the form of approximately 3,500 residential home elevations and alternative floodproofing methods for 342 non-residential structures and 157 warehouses (Figure 1). This is one of several federally funded initiatives aimed at reducing the risk of damage to infrastructure and communities along the coastline of Louisiana. Rather than relying on structural solutions such as seawalls or coastline levees, the Project focuses on implementing nonstructural measures (i.e., property elevations, property levees, floodwalls, door dams, or other floodproofing measures) to mitigate the impacts of coastal hazards in the state. It is a collaborative effort involving Federal, state, and local government agencies.



Scope: Only the work necessary to elevate or floodproof each structure in accordance with applicable codes, laws, regulations, and the requirements of this Contract, and to produce a product that&#39;s aesthetically equivalent to each structure&#39;s condition prior to the work under this contract, will be performed under this Contract. The work to be performed includes but is not limited to; design elements necessary to meet the requirements of the Request for Proposal (RFP), coordination with Federal, State, and local government and owners, permit applications, pre- and post-construction inspections, construction activities to raise residential structures and floodproof commercial and industrial structures, certified survey, and documentation of activities.

Title: The NIH NeuroBioBank Brain and Tissue Repository



INTRODUCTION

PURSUANT TO FAR Subpart 5.2&mdash;Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions, THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE OF A PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION.   



THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE NOTICE OF INTENT TO EXTEND THE &ldquo;NBB COLLECTION SITE&rdquo; CONTRACTS WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME).



The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to extend the NIH NeuroBioBank (NBB) Collection contracts for a period of six (6) months (May 1, 2025 to October 31, 2025). The current contracts are as follows:  Greater Los Angeles Veterans Research and Education (75N95019C00045), McLean Hospital contract (75N95019C00046), Pittsburgh University (75N95019C00047), State of Maryland (75N95019C00048), Mount Sinai School of Medicine contract (75N95019C00049) and Miami University (75N95019C00050) (i.e., the NBB Collection Sites).



NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE

The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 541714 &ndash; Research and Development in Biotechnology (except Nanobiotechnology) with a Size Standard of 1,000 employees.



REGULATORY AUTHORITY 

The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses of the Federal acquisition Requlation (FAR) in effect through the current Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC).



STATUTORY AUTHORITY 

This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1) under provisions of the statutory authority of FAR Subpart 6.302-1.





DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT 



Purpose and Objectives



The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke (NINDS), the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and the Blueprint for Neuroscience (https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov), National Institutes of Health (NIH) make human post-mortem brain tissue and related biospecimen samples widely available for research on neurological, psychiatric, and neurodevelopment disorders through multiple contract collection sites (i.e., the &ldquo;NIH NeuroBioBank&rdquo; or &ldquo;NBB&rdquo;)  which provide services to actively acquire, receive, store, characterize, catalog, preserve, and distribute human brain specimens to qualified investigators.



The purpose of the NIH NeuroBioBank support contract is to provide services that increase the availability of human brain tissue for research.  Multiple awardees/collection sites provide these services which provide critical resources for research on neurological, psychiatric, and neurodevelopmental disorders.  These multiple awardees/collection sites acquire at least 70 donors per year with the possibility of up to 150 unique human donors per year for a range of 350-1,000 by the end of the five (5) year contract period.



NIDA is in the process of awarding the follow-on competitive NIH NeuroBioBank and Tissue Repository requirement.  The contracts currently supporting the NIH NeuroBioBank were made via competitive awards on August 31, 2019 to the aforementioned NBB Collection Sites with a period of performance from September 1, 2019 through August 31, 2024.  These contracts were five (5) year Cost Reimbursement contracts with a combined total contract ceiling of $103,985,994. These contracts were extended for an 8-month period of performance from September 1, 2024 to May 1, 2025 with a combined total contract ceiling increase of $11,280,184.



The NBB Collection Sites are the only contractors that can fill the NIH NeuroBioBank&rsquo;s specific needs with minimal loss of disruption to the infrastructure of this critical research program.  If NIDA was to award a contract to any other contractor for this short period of time, it would create disruption of these research services and impact millions of dollars of completed and ongoing research.



As indicated by this notice, NIDA intends to extend the current NBB Collection Sites&rsquo; contracts to cover critical research services during the period between the end of the current contract period and the award of the follow-on competitive NIH NeuroBioBank and Tissue Repository requirement. Modifying the aforementioned contracts specified herein to extend the ordering period is the only possible way to ensure the continuation of these critical research and development services without a lapse in services and to ensure successful transition to the follow on contracts.

INTRODUCTION 

This is a Request for Information (RFI) ONLY, which is being released to industry for information gathering and planning purposes only pursuant to FAR Part 10 Market Research. This RFI is not a solicitation, nor shall this RFI constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), Invitation for Bid (IFB), or Request for Quote (RFQ). The Government shall not award any contract solely on the basis of this RFI nor shall the Government reimburse any Contractor for any associated costs they incur to submit a Capability Package to the Government in response to this RFI. This market research notice is being deployed to bring forth qualified, capable sources and in no way shall restrict the Government&rsquo;s final acquisition strategy, planning, or requirements refinement. 

OBJECTIVES 

One objective of this RFI is to identify potential vendors (large, small, and socioeconomic concerns) who have the experience and capabilities to successfully perform this work. Vendors are also encouraged to provide information regarding plans to use joint venturing (JV), partnering or consortiums to meet the requirements areas contained herein.  Details pertaining to the entire scope of work are contained in the attached Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS).  

A second objective is to engage industry to identify risks and opportunities, provide recommendations and other insights as it pertains to the acquisition and the work contemplated in the PWS.  

Additionally, if an RFP is subsequently issued, the Government anticipates a compressed response cycle; therefore, this RFI will provide advanced delivery of the attached Draft PWS, which should allow qualified vendors the necessary time to consider a potential RFP response/proposal and to build necessary teaming relationships.

The Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC) is seeking information from interested contractors for the Design and Construction of the Sentinel Systems Infrastructure Launch Facilities in missile fields, associated with three (3) different Air Force Bases (AFB).


	F.E. Warren (AFB) located in Wyoming, with launch facilities in Colorado, Nebraska, &amp; Wyoming.
	Malmstrom (AFB) located in Montana.
	Minot (AFB) Located in North Dakota.  


GENERAL SCOPE:

The United States Department of the Air Force (DAF) plans to procure the replacement of the Minuteman III infrastructure launch facilities that have reached the end of their lifecycle.

The Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center anticipates potential requirements for military construction (MILCON) of Sentinel Lauch Facilities located across five (5) states encompassing three (3) Air Force Bases. This requirement is anticipated to be accomplished as a Design-Build (DB) and/or Design-Bid-Build (DBB) project(s). The project execution window is currently anticipated between 2028-2040. The potential requirement may result in a solicitation issued approximately 2026.

The Sentinel Ground Based Strategic Deterrent Intercontinental Ballistic Missile System Program at these AFBs include constructing 450 launch facilities across 40,000 square miles.

 These new launch facilities will be located within secure boundaries. Sub-surface hardened silo dimensions are estimated to be 20 feet in diameter with a depth of 110 feet and hardened sub-surface support facilities estimated to be 1,000 to 2,000 square feet to house critical equipment.

Each launch facility will be permanent construction. These facilities will comply with Department of Defense Anti-terrorism/Force Protection requirements. Additionally, the hardened launch facilities will be equipped with delay and denial measures.

Additional information about the program can be found in the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) which is located here: https://www.afgsc.af.mil/Sentinel/Environmental-Impact-Statement/

In accordance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 236.204(v), the Government currently estimates the magnitude of construction for the potential project is over $500,000,000.

With current estimates of magnitude of construction for each location:

Between $5,000,000,000 and $10,000,000,000


	F.E. Warren (AFB)
	Malmstrom (AFB)
	Minot (AFB) 


The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for the potential requirement is anticipated to be 237990 Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction. The small business size standard for the NAICS, as established by the U.S. Small Business Administration, is $45,000,000 annual revenue. The Product Service Code for the potential requirement is anticipated to be Y1BF, Construction of Missile Systems Facilities.

If there is a reasonable expectation that at least two (2) responsible small business concerns under this NAICS can provide the anticipated services at fair market prices, the Contracting Officer is required to set the acquisition aside for small business concerns. If competition is set-aside for small businesses, Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, requires that general construction small business Contractors self-perform at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the cost of the contract, not including the cost of materials. If no set aside is made, the requirement is competed with full and open competition, and the awarded Contractor is not a small business, the Contractor will be required to self-perform the percent of work identified in the solicitation under FAR 52.236-1, Performance of Work by the Contractor.

Contractors with the skill, capabilities, workload capacity, and ability to obtain bonding to complete the project described above (either through self-performance and/or Subcontractor management) are invited to provide capability statements to the primary point of contact listed below. Since information received from this sources sought synopsis will be used to make acquisition decisions, both small businesses and other than small businesses are encouraged to submit responses to the Capability Statements, PLA Survey and Request for Information attachments.

This announcement seeks information from industry and will only be used for preliminary planning purposes.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. 

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Jacksonville District is issuing this sources sought synopsis as a means of conducting market research to gauge the interest, capabilities and qualifications of various members of the Construction Community, to include Small Businesses, as the Government must ensure there is adequate competition amongst the potential pool of responsible contractors. This requirement is for the potential fiscal year (FY) 2026 award of the construction of the S-356E Pump Station, S-334E Spillway, and new segment of the L-29 Levee as part of the Central Everglades Planning Project (CEPP), one of the elements of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP).

There is no solicitation at this time.  This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals and submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary. The proposed project will be a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract. The Jacksonville Districts anticipates the issuance of a Request for Proposal (RFP). No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this Sources Sought or any follow-up information requested.

Project Description:

The CEPP South, Contract 2A, S-356E Pump Station and S-334E Spillway project is in western Miami-Dade County at the intersection of the L-29 Canal, the L-30 Canal, and the L-31N Borrow Canal. The structures will be constructed in the L-29 Canal, adjacent Tamiami Trail (US-41), approximately 1/4 mile east of the existing S-334 Spillway and the temporary S-356 Pump Station.

The project work includes excavation, dewatering, blasting, and construction for a new levee system, a new pump station structure, a new spillway structure, and new bulkhead walls. These new project components are constructed east of the existing S-356 pump station and S-334 spillway. The overall site is approximately 20 acres. Specific project components include the following items and incidental related work:


	A new levee system located along the northern side of the project site, approximately 1,600-feet long, with a crest width of 16.0 feet with 3H:1V side slopes.
	A new pump station structure has a total pumping capacity of 1,250 cfs that consists of four (4) 250 cfs diesel motor driven pumps and two (2) 125 cfs electric motor driven pumps, superstructure, substructure, service bridge, and vehicle access ramps.
	A new spillway structure with a design capacity of 1,200 cfs with two (2) bays, vertical lift roller gate, and a service bridge.
	Both structures will have an anchored steel pile bulkhead wall located at the intake bay and discharge of the pump station
	The installation of rip rap slope protection along the canal banks and canal bottom of the L-29 canal.


Specific Project Challenges:

1.         The primary challenge associated with CEPP South, Contract 2A is limited access to the project site, which must be managed and maintained at all times.  The project site is accessible by crossing the existing S-334 spillway structure to U.S. 41 (Tamiami Trail), as such, prospective contractors must take into account not only the limited access but management of traffic throughout the project duration to ensure the safety of the general public and those performing the associated work.

2.         In addition to the limited access, there is ongoing widening work being conducted on multiple segments of U.S. 41.  USACE is working to obtain the appropriate Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan Regulation Act (CERPRA) permit from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), however the construction contractor will be responsible for obtaining any additional permits from the FDEP and the SFWMD for water use authorization and stormwater discharge during construction. The work will require the simultaneous management of organic excavation and embankment material placement in the wet, within a wetland area. The work will require surface and groundwater management to ensure proper construction occurs per project specifications.

3.         Requisite work will require excavation of muck and blasting of rock and require importing material from off-site to construct the project. The pump station and gated spillway structure will require construction of cofferdams and significant dewatering to maintain a dry working surface on the cofferdams interior for construction of these mass concrete structures.

The Estimated Magnitude of construction is between $100,000,000 and $250,000,000.

The estimated period of performance for the base contract is 2,548 calendar days from receipt of the date of Notice to Proceed.

The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 237990, Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction.  The Small Business Size Standard for this project is $45.0 million.

Performance evaluations for key joint venture partners, subcontractors, consultants and free-lance associates will also be considered.

A firm&rsquo;s Past Performance will be evaluated to determine how relevant and how well past performance efforts have been accomplished. Past Performance shall have occurred within the five (5) years prior to the closing date of this synopsis. The relevancy of Past Performance information will be based on similarities of the work in terms of complexity, scope and size to what is being acquired.

PROGRAM BACKGROUND

The CRX Program is a critical initiative designed to enhance the readiness and operational effectiveness of ARNG Brigades. This program culminates home-station training strategies by delivering rigorous, integrated force-on-force training events that prepare Brigades for future readiness-building objectives or operational deployments. The CRX program supports the training of up to five Brigades annually across multiple regional home-station locations, with the capability to train two Brigades simultaneously within the same timeframe.

Each 15-day rotation features a multi-echelon exercise, integrating sourced enablers, and focuses on achieving Brigade T-Level 3 (T3) proficiency through practical application at the Brigade and Battalion staff. The program is structured into two distinct models: CRX A, which focuses on Combat Training Center (CTC) bound units in training year two, and CRX B, which supports units in training year three. All rotations are conducted regionally within a fully instrumented Decisive Action Training Environment (DATE) to replicate the complexities of Large-Scale Combat Operations (LSCO).

These exercises evaluate everything from operational, tactical and leadership skills to staff processes, and the effectiveness of communication systems in a contested environment. Brigades are expected to execute Reception Staging Onward Movement, Integration (RSOI), Platoon Situational Tactical Exercises (STX), Leadership Training Program (LTP), Platoon and Company Field Training Exercise (FTX) with mission command at Echelon, Reverse Reception Staging Onward Movement, and Integration (RRSOI). The program is centered around five lines of effort: Rotational Design (RD), Operational Environment (OE), Instrumentation, Training Aids, Devices, Simulators, and Simulations (ITADSS), Operational Readiness, and Reporting (ORR). The contractor should have a thorough understanding of Infantry, Stryker, and Armored Brigade Combat Team (ABCT) readiness, academics, Command Post Exercise (CPX), Field Training Exercise (FTX), Observer Coach/Trainer (OC/T), Reception, Staging, Onward Movement and Integration (RSOI), Event Life Cycle (ELC) events, Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES), Opposing Forces (OPFOR) integration, exercise reporting, readiness partner integration, rotational training unit selection, enablers, commodities, exercise capabilities, Distinguished Visitors (DV), and senior trainer role.

Program Management. Provide the Army National Guard Collective Training (ARNG-TRC) branch with a high level of organization, strategic planning, and support to the CRX Program Manager. The ability to orchestrate numerous teams, resources, and logistics while adhering to a strict timeline necessitates a systematic and demanding approach. The Program Management Office (PMO) shall establish clear objectives, delineate roles and responsibilities, and create comprehensive workflows to ensure seamless operation throughout the ELC through the After-Action Reviews (AARs) culmination. Effective communication and availability to the CRX Program Manager is the core of managing such exercises, as it is essential to synchronize the efforts of cross-functional teams and external stakeholders. Risk management strategies must be identified and mitigated for potential issues before they escalate. Additionally, data-driven analysis is critical to decision-making and continuous process improvements to adapt to changing circumstances and optimize performance. A highly detailed quality control plan with feedback mechanisms will enable effective program management. Tools and technologies must be established to track real-time progress, ensuring tasks are executed on time to complete projects and objectives successfully. Specifically, the PMO shall provide real-time oversight through commander dashboards, equipment dashboards, rotational training unit readiness dashboards, and exercise dashboards.

Provide the ARNG-TRC branch with high-level organization, strategic planning, and operational support to the CRX Program Manager. The execution of this mission demands exceptional coordination of teams, resources, and logistics within strict timelines, requiring a systematic and results-driven approach. The PMO shall establish clear objectives, define roles and responsibilities, and develop comprehensive workflows to ensure seamless operations throughout the Event Life Cycle, culminating in the delivery of AAR&rsquo;s.

Central to this effort is maintaining effective communication and availability to the CRX Program Manager, ensuring synchronized efforts across cross-functional teams and external stakeholders. Proactive risk management will be essential, with strategies developed to identify and mitigate potential issues before they arise. Furthermore, data-driven analysis will underpin decision-making and continuous process improvements, enabling the program to adapt to changing circumstances and achieve optimal performance.

A Management Information System (MIS) coupled with a detailed quality control plan, including robust feedback mechanisms, will be critical for successful program execution. Advanced tools and technologies must be implemented to provide real-time oversight and track progress effectively. These include commander dashboards, equipment dashboards, rotational training unit readiness dashboards, and exercise dashboards. By leveraging these capabilities, the PMO shall ensure timely task execution, operational efficiency, and achievement of program objectives.

Exercise control. The contractor shall provide an exercise control system with dedicated teams for orchestrating realistic training scenarios, effect real-time adjustments, and provide oversight of all exercise objectives. These teams must oversee the entire ELC, typically 36 months, through current and subsequent year planning efforts. Exercise design and training scenarios shall be challenging to the Brigade while ensuring safety and compliance with the established rules of engagement during rotation execution. Must be able to balance structure and flexibility, allowing the Brigade to react to Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrating Architectures (LVC-IA) using threats and make decisions that align with the rotational training objectives. Ideally, the centralized system shall integrate video feeds and sensors that provide environmental conditions that trigger specific events. Optimal characteristics of the exercise control system are government solutions with Common Training Instrumentation Architecture (CTIA) compliance. Contractor teams must be able to monitor the progress of the Brigade and provide timely feedback. The system&#39;s core function will be to assist in the creation and development of AARs  to evaluate performance and identify ways to improve training outcomes. The contractor teams must be able to monitor the training progress of the Brigade and provide timely feedback. Teams must be able to validate capabilities and readiness but also enhance operational cohesion and decision-making skills in a contested environment. The system must display rotational information (dashboards or windows) in near real-time. This information will allow for the management and re-direction of training resources as necessary to ensure rotational training objectives are satisfied. Due consideration should be given to the infrastructure and logistical requirements for the exercise control system requirements.



Instrumentation and Communication. The contractor shall provide a basic tracking system for instrumentation purposes, including video integration capability to develop and assist in creating AARs products. The system will monitor the Brigade and its enablers in real-time with instrumentation requirements at select Staff Sergeant (SSG/E-6) leaders and above level. The ideal system should be able to integrate planning tools and communication platforms. Instrumentation capacity will support up to two Brigades simultaneously at disparate training locations. The contractor shall provide an administrative network for non-tactical communication between the rotation functional entities. The communication network focuses on safety considerations and administrative requirements throughout the rotation.



Battlefield Effects. Simulate realistic battlefield effects within the rotation to create an immersive effect on the Brigade in a contested training environment. These effects must mimic the sights, sounds, and smells experienced during actual combat, psychologically conditioning and preparing the Brigade for future exercises or mobilizations. Teams should consider using controlled pyrotechnics and explosives to replicate ordinance detonations, smoke machines, or fog generators to recreate obscured visibility and sound systems that project the cacophony of gunfire, explosions, and vehicle movements. These effects must be coordinated with the exercise control team to support varying tactical scenarios, emphasizing realism while maintaining safe training parameters. Additional battlefield effects may include the integration of drones, cyber, electronic warfare effects, and nascent threat capabilities.



Emergent Threat Integration. The contractor shall integrate emergent threats to prepare the Brigade for the dynamic environment. Current evolving threats, from cyber warfare and unmanned systems to hybrid warfare tactics and information operations, require a multidimensional approach to live, virtual, and constructive scenario planning.

Touch Screen Tactile Enhancements

The training of Navy sailors on the conduct of routine and abnormal evolutions is an important element of maintaining operational fleet readiness. Traditional simulator training, especially for seated panel operators inside of a control room, has utilized physical panels that simulate the real hardware panels with respect to appearance, panel response, sound, and tactile feedback. The exterior of the panels resembles the reference plant and includes a mixture of 2 or more position switches, push buttons, and rheostats for input and various digital and analog output devices.  The interior of the panels is not prototypic and instead primarily contains programmable logic controllers that connect the panel&rsquo;s hardware interfaces with remotely networked simulation computers. Though much less expensive than the actual reference plant panels, physical panels used for training are still costly, require maintenance, and encounter issues due to availability and obsolescence of parts. These costs have increased significantly over the past several years. 

More recently, large touch screens that mimic a physical panel&rsquo;s appearance, provide prototypic plant indications including sounds, and enable component manipulations via touch screen gestures have been introduced for training. Touch screen-based panels are much less expensive to build and maintain than their physical counterparts.  One set of touch screen panels can even be used to interface with different reference platforms. The primary disadvantage of touch screen-based panels compared with physical panels is the lack of tactile feedback and muscle memory that can be acquired with physical hardware component manipulations. Additional challenges arise when the user needs to manipulate components on one surface of a panel while viewing the results of their manipulations on another face of the panel, leading to drift in finger/hand placement.

Examples of technologies that could improve the tactile feedback of touch screen-based panel trainers include:
&bull;    OnGlass Controls
&bull;    Electroadhesion
&bull;    Linear haptic actuators
&bull;    Piezo elements
&bull;    Touchplates

Technical proposals are being sought on technologies that would result in improved tactile feedback over that obtained from touch screen-based component manipulations alone, while still benefitting from the reduced upfront and lifecycle costs compared with physical panels. An ideal technology would be reconfigurable to allow a given touch screen panel to represent different panel variations, function reliably, and require minimal time and effort to switch between different configurations.

FMP is seeking a technical proposal to support the above problem statement.  Technical proposals can be submited to the point of contact identified on this oppurtunity by the specfifed date.

PROJECT: Control No. W912DR25R13GV: Child Development Center - V (CDC-V), Fort Meade, Maryland.



No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this notice or any follow-up information requests.

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for Market Research ONLY to determine the availability of Brand Name Items.

The United States Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District intends to include the following proprietary items in a request for proposal for a construction contract acquisition under the authority of FAR 6.302-5(a)(2)(ii), Authorized or required by statute.  This project may include a Brand Name only component, as described below, unless the results of this sources sought notification indicates otherwise.

This notification serves three purposes: (1) to notify potential Offerors of the Government&#39;s intent to solicit a brand name only component under a future construction project; (2) to identify potential sources that can provide the brand name only item and/or equivalent; (3) notification of the Army&#39;s intent to contract sole source for a Brand Name Only, if the market is unable to provide &#39;equivalent&#39; products.

In the event no equivalent equipment exists, the Brand Name Only justification will be issued pursuant to FAR 6.302-5(a)(2)(ii). A subsequent market survey will not be published in support of a Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) for sole sourcing the resultant product(s) or system(s) in the event an equivalent product is not submitted for consideration. In such instances, the brand name or equal component will be embedded in the construction project. Only that part of the project requiring brand name components will be sole sourced if no sources are able to prove an equal product.

SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENT: The construction project will include Brand Name only equipment as follows:

Fire Alarm Radio Transmitter: The Fire Alarm System that is to be installed within the new facility is required by Code to transmit signals to a the constantly attended Directorate of Emergency Services (DES)/Fire Department, which uses a Monaco D-21 received. This project must include a radio transmitter that is compatible with the existing receiver equipment in order to transmit the required signals. The use of any other manufacturer would result in the inability to send fire alarm signals to the Base Fire Department as required.

Interested vendors must show clear and convincing evidence that alternatives to the specified items exist. Interested vendors wishing to be considered by the Government as described above must provide a copy of its brochure and any other capability statements/ data no later than 28 March 2025, 11:00 AM EDT, to Contract Specialist, Amber Rose, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, Contracting Division, via email to amber.L.rose@usace.army.mil.

This is a market survey and notification of intent only. This is not a request to respond to a solicitation. A determination by the Government to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the direction of the Government.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Nashville District (LRN) is issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP), W912P525RA001, for a single firm fixed-price construction contract for the Chickamauga Lock Replacement Approach Wall and Decommissioning Project in Chattanooga, TN.


PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The scope of this project will consist of the construction of river and middle approach walls downstream from the lock, decommissioning the existing lock, the wet commissioning of the lock chamber constructed in the lock chamber contract, and site restoration activities at the project site. Downstream lock approach walls will be constructed from pre-cast concrete beams that were fabricated in 2012 and are currently stored at another Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) facility until ready to be installed at the project. The downstream approach wall will extend under and through the Norfolk Southern Railway Bridge. Two (2) new 30-foot diameter mooring cells will be built downstream of the new lock. Once the existing lock is closed, a portion of the lock chamber and the associated wall culverts will be plugged with concrete. A concrete thrust block will be installed to resist concrete expansion in the dam, and the remaining area will be filled with stone. Miscellaneous equipment and buildings will be removed. No cofferdams will be required for decommissioning the existing lock, but installation of needle dams (similar to a cofferdam, but more temporary) may be required for dewatering of the chamber. The downstream approach wall, decommissioning of the existing lock, wet commissioning of the new lock, and site restoration contract is anticipated to be awarded in Fourth Quarter of Fiscal Year 2025 with a base and three (3) options.

DISCLOSURE OF MAGNITUDE OF THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT: The estimated price range is between $250,000,000 and $500,000,000.

Description of Effort

Strategic Objective

Platform One is seeking to identify potential vendors, technologies, and system integrators capable of providing innovative, dual-use commercial products and/or services enabling the scalable centralized management of cloud and DevSecOps infrastructure.

Technical Information

If selected, comprehensive technical requirements will be detailed in a follow-on SOO, SOW, PWS or other requirement documentation. The following technical requirements are informational only and subject to change. Prospective vendors who intend to submit a video submission are advised to adhere to the evaluation criteria laid out in the P1SM solicitation and to select Strategic Focus Area(s) that best fit your submission.

Ideal solutions should be effective for workloads operating across multiple AWS GovCloud accounts; however, preference will be given to solutions which are agnostic of cloud service providers. Solutions should, at minimum, effectively manage the repeatable, auditable, and automated configuration, deployment, and sustainment of Kubernetes distributions, Platform One&rsquo;s Big Bang, and additional mission-specific containerized applications. 

Product vendors should anticipate the need to include integration services within this effort either internally or in partnership with a systems integrator. System integrators without a vendor partnership will be considered if leveraging commercial and/or open-source tools in accordance with all applicable licenses.  

Platform One Solutions Marketplace (P1SM) Information

Current P1SM Vendors with Awardable Solution(s)

Current P1SM Vendors with active awardable solution(s) that are or potentially could be within scope of this effort are advised to identify the active awardable solution(s) and send the submission title and/or P1SM URL link to their awardable solution to both the Contracting and Technical POC&#39;s listed above via email.

Prospective P1SM Vendors

Interested vendors that do not have an active awardable solution(s) on the P1SM within scope of this effort are advised to provide a video submission to the P1SM via the P1SM Industry Portal located at https://www.p1-marketplace.com. Please reference the P1SM solicitation posted to SAM.gov: https://sam.gov/opp/a0616420e81f432aaaa4abb7a05ea537/view. P1 is requesting submissions prior to 31 March 2025 so interested vendors will be included in the April evaluation schedule.

Platform One plans to leverage the P1SM for related sequential award(s) and/or agreement(s), potentially including a Prototype Other Transaction (OT) with options for a follow-on Production OT. Regardless of selection by Platform One for this effort, awardable P1SM submissions are post-competition, decentralized and may be leveraged by other Federal organizations for future awards and/or agreements.

Support and POC Information

For administrative questions on the P1SM, Platform One has a dedicated support team ready to assist with questions regarding the P1SM. The team can be reached by emailing: support@p1-marketplace.com. They also hold regularly scheduled office hours, which can be scheduled using the following link: https://outlook.office365.us/book/PlatformOneOfficeHours@theari.us/

For contractual questions, please reach out to Platform One&#39;s Chief of Contracting, Maj Jamail Walker at jamail.walker.1@us.af.mil.

Government Non-Commitment   

This Call to Industry for potential solutions or to identify active, awardable solutions, is issued solely for information-gathering purposes and vectoring vendors to the P1SM. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Request for Quotation (RFQ) and shall not be construed as a commitment by the government.

Peer Review Services
Market Research Request for Information

Background

Pursuant to FAR Part 10, the federal government is conducting market research to determine 


	What sources exist that can satisfy the requirements listed below, 



	The appropriate NAICS code, 



	The capabilities of potential contractors,  



	The size and status of potential sources, and 



	The level of competition.




The Office of Justice Program (OJP) is a component within the U.S. Department of Justice comprised of six statutorily authorized program offices supported by eight business offices (see www.ojp.gov/about).



OJP is the largest grantmaking component of the Department of Justice and houses the Department&rsquo;s criminal and juvenile justice, science, statistics, and programmatic agencies. OJP provides federal leadership, funding, training and technical assistance, research and statistics, and other critical resources to advance work that strengthens community safety, promotes civil rights, increases access to justice, supports crime victims and individuals impacted by the justice system, and builds trust between law enforcement and communities. OJP comprises six program offices which develop notices of funding opportunities (NOFOs) and manage the programmatic review of applications. The program offices are:


	Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA)
	Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS)
	National Institute of Justice (NIJ)
	Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP)
	Office of Sexual Offender Sentencing, Monitoring, Apprehending, Registering, and Tracking (SMART Office)
	Office for Victims of Crime (OVC)




OJP is seeking information from interested vendors to support OJP&rsquo;s Peer Review Services effort.



A critical component of the grantmaking process is to assess the merits of applications for proposed grant funded projects. The peer review process is a central part of that application merit review that provides objective, independent, advisory review of the applications. Peer reviewers identify and assess the strengths and weaknesses of applications in accordance with the goals and objectives of the funding opportunity. An initial step of application review is the basic minimum requirements (BMR) review, which screens applications for compliance with basic NOFO requirements to determine which applications should progress to peer review.



OJP anticipates awarding a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) or Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract vehicle to provide logistical and administrative support for peer reviews for OJP program offices. Related support for other components or offices may be included. Task Orders, both fixed-price and time-and-materials, or a hybrid of both, would be issued from the contract vehicle to support program office grant peer reviews.



The contractor will manage the technical assistance and provide the logistical support required for peer reviews and other peer review-related activities that support OJP&rsquo;s mission. The contractor must be attentive to detail, excel at making logistical arrangements and decisions, and be responsive to OJP&#39;s needs.  In fiscal year 2024, OJP peer reviewed 153 notices of funding opportunities that received around 6200 applications requiring nearly 1700 peer reviewers to provide assessments. Additionally, the contractor will be required to coordinate with other OJP contractors and partners to accomplish the tasks required under this order.  All OJP peer reviews supported under this order will be conducted using OJP&#39;s grants management system and other systems. Therefore, the contractor must coordinate with OJP to obtain training to ensure that peer reviewers and contractor staff can use the OJP system functionalities.



Scope

In general, the required work is associated with various phases and types of peer review, including but not limited to the following: 



(1) Peer Review Planning and Management


	Recommend enhancements to and implement practices in accordance with the OJP peer review standard operating procedures;



	Recommend updates to the OJP peer review training materials for both internal staff (OJP employees) and external individuals (peer reviewers), ad update the OJP peer review training materials upon approval of the recommended changes;
	Assist in the facilitation of the OJP peer review training for both internal staff (OJP employees) and external individuals (peer reviewers);
	Develop and implement an outreach strategy to recruit reviewers with relevant experience;
	Assess individuals&rsquo; applications to become peer reviewers and provide recommendations to OJP staff in order to ensure the quality of the peer reviewer pool meets OJP standards;
	Analyze peer reviewer data and prepare reports;
	Hold kick-off meetings with each program office;
	Hold notice of funding opportunity forecast meetings to set schedules;
	Manage and track meeting logistics and schedules;
	Develop automated standard forms and guidance documents;
	Estimate the budget of the peer review and track costs;

(3) Peer Review Format Management

OJP program offices may select one of the following types of peer review:


	Collaboration Review &ndash; Peer reviewers complete an initial review of the applications online and enter scores and comments of the merit of the applications in the system. Then, peer reviewers participate in a virtual collaboration meeting to discuss their initial assessments before finalizing their scores and comments in the system.
	Initial Only Review &ndash; Peer reviewers complete only the online application review in the system without convening a collaboration meeting.
	In-person Collaboration Review &ndash; Peer reviewers review the merit of applications online and then travel to a meeting to discuss scores and comments. Scores and comments are finalized as a group at the meeting.
	Standing Review Panel &ndash; A group of reviewers serve for a term of two to three years to review the technical merit of applications under multiple NOFOs and participate in virtual or in-person collaboration meetings to discuss the applications.
	Concept Paper Review &ndash; Peer reviewers assess brief narratives to evaluate the merit of the concept paper. Applicants whose concept papers are determined to be most promising are invited to submit full proposals that peer reviewers then assess using collaboration reviews.

Questions and Answers:


	Can you confirm the list of government-furnished materials and the process for transportation to the site? Print off the SOW before arrival, your POV will be the transportation
	Are there any specific restrictions or safety measures related to the handling of asbestos during demolition? Follow the asbestos abatement plan.
	Could you provide additional clarification on the exact procedures for requesting work outside normal hours and the approval process? You send a Request to the PM and He/She will request after hour time.
	What are the specific utility shutdown procedures and required notifications to the COR? Notify PM (up to Day-of) and He or She will make it happen
	Could you clarify the steps for managing and reporting any changes in project scope during demolition? Contact the PM.
	Could you provide more details on the DBIDS site visit access process? Specifically, are there any additional steps or requirements for our team to complete before attending the February 26, 2025 site visit? Yes submit QR Code no later then 1430 on 2/25/2025.
	Regarding the proposal/bid submission, could you clarify the submission process via DOD SAFE, particularly the deadline for requesting the &quot;Drop Off&quot; link and any other critical submission instructions? -- The Contracting Officer (KO) will annotate contractor attendance at the site visit, as well as make an update to SAM asking for industry participants to reach out to KO with their email addresses so KO can open the DOD SAFE link for them to submit bid docs. There are limits on how early KO can do that with DOD SAFE, so the link will not be opened until after the site visit.
	Submission via DOD SAFE: Is the proposal required to be submitted through DOD SAFE, or is this platform strictly for bid submission? -- DOD SAFE is for bid submission. Any docs that you would submit with your bid may go through there (ex/ bid price document as well as non-price proposal documents). That is the official place to submit your docs, because it timestamps the submissions with both the government&rsquo;s notice and your notice.
	Submission Requirements: If the proposal must be uploaded to DOD SAFE, please confirm any specific instructions, required documents, or additional steps necessary to comply. -- See question 7
	Deadline Compliance: Is there a specific cut-off time for submission on March 12, 2025, or will proposals be accepted until 11:59 PM ET? -- The due date is 11:59pm Eastern. You have the full day to submit bids through DOD SAFE. If there are any changes to this plan, I will notify everyone publicly via SAM, and likely offer an extension for fairness.
	Confirmation of Receipt: Once submitted, will we receive an official acknowledgment, and who should we contact if we encounter any technical issues? -- Yes, DOD SAFE will sent confirmations to both you and I.

It is the government&rsquo;s understanding that companies other than Wheelabrator would have difficulties in providing replacement parts due to the proprietary drawings and specifications which belong to Wheelabrator for these systems.  Additionally, it is the government&rsquo;s understanding that any company who would attempt to align these non-Wheelabrator parts with the Wheelabrator system would have to re-engineer these parts and likely cause interface issues with the existing Wheelabrator system, which, in turn would cause the system(s) to lose functionality. 

This notice does NOT constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, or invitation for bid. The intent of this notice is to identify potential offerors for market research purposes. 

Interested parties should respond no later than 26 March 2025, 12PM, EDT.

In response to this sources sought, the Government is requesting the following information:




	 Are there contractors who have been successful in re-engineering/retrofitting parts to align and interface with Wheelabrator systems?
	Does industry believe there is low risk to using non-Wheelabrator parts with a Wheelabrator system?  In other words, does industry believe the likelihood of interface systems issues is low or non-existent?
	Has industry been successful in obtaining drawings and specifications from Wheelabrator which they have then used to re-engineer parts as described above (Abrasive Reclaim Systems [Blast Media Elevators], each composed of a Hopper, Elevator, Rotary Drum, and Air-Wash Separator) which have successfully interfaced with Wheelabrator systems and blast media recovery systems.
	Any other information as to why there may or may not be concerns with using non-Wheelabrator parts with a Wheelabrator system.

NOTICE: The following information is provided for situational awareness and is not required to respond to this Sources Sought.



All contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (www.SAM.gov) prior to award of a contract. All proposed contractors are highly encouraged to review FAR Clause 52.232-33 Payments by Electronic Funds Transfer &ndash; System for Award Management, which indicates &ldquo;All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT).&rdquo; Those not currently registered can obtain registration by going to the website http://www.SAM.gov. The process can usually be completed from 24 to 48 hours after submission. Contractors will need to obtain a Unique Entity Identifier (formerly DUNS number) for processing their registration. If you do not already have a Unique Entity Identifier, one can be obtained from http://www.SAM.gov. Refer to www.SAM.gov for information formerly found in CCR, EPLS, ORCA and FedReg.



Please begin the registration process immediately in order to avoid delay of the contract award should your firm be selected.



ALERT: You must submit a notarized letter appointing the authorized Entity Administrator before your registration will be activated. This requirement now applies to both new and existing entities. Effective 29 April 2018, the notarized letter process is now mandatory on all CURRENT registrants at SAM who have a requirement to update data on their SAM record.  The notarized letter is mandatory and is required before the GSA Federal Service Desk (FSD) will activate the entity&#39;s registration. 



Effective 29 June 2018, vendors creating or updating their registration can have their registration activated prior to the approval of the required notarized letter.  However, the signed copy of the notarized letter must be sent to the GSA Federal Service Desk (FSD) within 30 days of activation or the vendor risks no longer being active in SAM.



Vendors can check whether an account is active by performing a query by their CAGE or Unique Entity Identifier (known as DUNS). The new registration process may now take several weeks, so vendors are highly encouraged to begin registering as soon as possible to avoid any possible delays in future contract awards. Remember, there is no cost to use SAM.

1.0 Problem Statement  

The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) seeks innovative solutions leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of its financial reporting and audit processes. As one of the largest government agencies, DLA undergoes annual financial statement and control-based audits. These audits are time-consuming and resource-intensive, often requiring manual review and analysis of large volumes of data to support complex assertions such as the completeness and accuracy of inventory balances. DLA is pursuing transformative, high-impact solutions to streamline these processes, resolve existing material weaknesses, improve audit quality, and reduce the burden on its personnel.  



2.0 Background 

DLA manages the end-to-end global defense supply chain &ndash; from raw material to end user disposition &ndash; for the five military services, 11 combatant commands, other federal, state and local agencies, and partner and allied nations. DLA&rsquo;s mission is to &ldquo;deliver readiness and lethality to the Warfighter Always and support our nation through quality, proactive global logistics.&rdquo;  

The purpose of this call to industry is to attract and identify best-of-breed solutions to address the problem set and meet operational capabilities.  This aligns with the objectives set forth in Sec. 1007 of the Fiscal Year 2025 National Defense Authorization Act, which underscores the importance of AI technology in auditing financial statements within the DoD. With the increasing complexity of financial reporting requirements and the massive amount of data to be managed, DLA is looking to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) into its financial reporting processes. DLA is committed to leveraging cutting-edge technology to optimize its operations and ensure the highest level of transparency and accountability in its financial reporting, enhance its decision-making abilities, identify potential cost-saving opportunities, and improve the overall effectiveness of its financial management. 

3.0 Desired Solution Features 

3.1 Phased approach to demonstrate the potential of AI, focused on financial reporting and audit processes prioritizing features, that offers the greatest potential for impact while minimizing initial development complexity. 

3.2 Develop and demonstrate a prototype solution that resolves potential Pain Points, addresses Operational Capabilities, or presents a new approach: 

Pain Points: 


	
	Time-consuming and resource-intensive processes 
	



	
	Manual review and analysis of large volumes of data 
	



	
	Potential for human error in identifying anomalies and discrepancies 
	



	
	Difficulty in identifying and addressing potential errors and accuracy 
	




3.3 Establish a feedback loop within the prototype to enable continuous improvement of the proposed solution.   

3.4 Vendors must have solutions that are at the IL4 level and be FEDRAMP Moderate certified with 90 days of award. However, it is expected that an offeror can achieve IL 5 level and FEDRAMP High certification.  

4.0 Project Expectations  

4.1 In 12-16 weeks, iteratively demonstrate phased approach to how solution will address operational capabilities below, or another critical capability, demonstrate potential for scalability and adaptation to other financial processes or components in future phases. 

4.2       Demonstrate the envisioned AI capabilities that should lead to addressing operational capabilities listed below, a significant reduction in manual processing errors, substantially faster reporting times, and/or more insightful analytics capable of detecting irregularities. 



4.3 Hosting - Initial prototypes could leverage vendor hosted environments. This is dependent on technical details of the hosting environment and cybersecurity controls in place. NOTE: Any long-term hosting in a vendor environment (i.e. Software as a Service SaaS) would require FedRAMP authorization. Additionally, DLA operates private cloud environments leveraging major providers (Azure, AWS, etc.) that can host vendor solutions once appropriately vetted. Offerors are encouraged to submit solution briefs that outline how their solution is currently hosted and describe the level of effort to meet DoD cybersecurity standards. 





4.4 Solution providers should expect to participate in a shared development space with other vendors and government developers to rapidly deploy, monitor and iterate upon solutions. Solution providers may be asked to collaborate and/or participate in cross-functional efforts and/or in a teaming arrangement. The government intends to identify one or more integrators as a solution provider, but vendors are also welcome to team with integrators prior to submission. 



 5.0 Operational Capabilities  

Here are some major categories that are currently impacting the DoD audit results. Please note that this list is not exhaustive. Feel free to select a category from this list, but if there are other areas that may be advantageous for DOD in achieving a clean audit, consider those as well.  

5.1 Unresolved accounting issues and material weaknesses in internal controls that cause DoD to be unable to provide sufficient evidential support for complete and accurate financial statements on a timely basis. Incorporate natural language processing (NLP) capabilities to allow for efficient data entry and report generation. Refer to the report on independent auditor&rsquo;s link. (https://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/afr/fy2024/4-Financial_Section.pdf). 

5.2 Modernize policies, procedures and internal controls surrounding documentation of procurements, shipments, and other movements, tracking of inventory by owner, validating the perpetual inventory systems by performing periodic physical counts, accumulating cost of inventory and supporting inventory balances and transactions. 

5.3 Reconcile the activity that impact the Fund Balance with Treasury (FBwT) between the general ledger and the US treasury. 

5.4        Update financial systems to substantially comply with The Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 (FFMIA). 

5.5 Design and implement internal controls related to the following six areas. 1) Access controls 2) Configuration Management 3) Segregation of Duties 4) Security Management 5) Information Technology Operations 6) Interfaces. 

5.6       Support the valuation, existence and completeness of general property plant equipment (PP&amp;E). 

5.7 Implement processes to comply with the Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards 54 (Leases). 

5.8 Account for, manage, or report Joint Strike Fighter Program government property, which is composed of Global Spares Pool assets, or accurately record this property in an accountable property system of record. 

5.9 Support the completeness and accuracy of environmental liabilities recorded in the financial statements. 

5.10 Establish balances and implement a DoD-wide procedure to monitor, report, and ensure DoD Components have complete and accurate beginning balances. 

5.11 Develop a method to research and correct the underlying problems that result in unsupported journal vouchers. 

5.12     Obtain from accounting systems the support necessary to reconcile trading partner differences in accounting (Revenue and expenses, accounts payable, accounts receivable, etc.) 

5.13 Eliminate excessive manual preparation of the annual financial report (to include note disclosures and background information). 

5.14    Aggregate all DLA inventory data into a single system and reconcile the data to all feeder systems real-time, thereby supporting the assertions of accurate and complete perpetual inventory which can be queried DoD-Wide with mil-service partners.

AE Community &ndash; In FY24, we issued a sources sought under the name &ldquo;AENETZERO,&rdquo; which referenced Executive Order (EO) 14057. However, as this EO has been rescinded, we have revised this Architect-Engineer (AE) requirement to align with the Administration&rsquo;s current objectives. We have also updated the name of the program from &ldquo;AENETZERO&rdquo; to the reduced/adjusted scope that reflects &ldquo;Resilient AE Services (RAES)&rdquo; The previous sources sought included a number of objectives, and as a result of the recission to EO 14507, a few of those objectives no longer apply and thus are not included in the RAES program. However, other objectives remain and will continue to be part of the RAES program. The sources sought (attached) mirrors the sources sought that we published with AENETZERO, but removes objectives that were directly associated with EO14057.


The specific objectives removed from Paragraph 4) of the previous sources sought, include the following (note that sub-paragraph j is modified, rather than fully deleted, such that the underlined/italicized words are removed):

     a)    Design for Net Zero buildings.  A Net Zero building is a building where, as defined in EO 14057, Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from all building energy use are equal to zero on an annual basis.

     d)     Design of the electrification of standard building operation, including domestic heating, production of hot water, laundry, cooking, and other equipment.       

     h)   Design for the use of low embodied carbon materials. 

     j)     Design for deep energy retrofits as defined in EO 14057 Implementing Instructions.

As a result of these changes, we are opening up this sources sought again to see if there are any additional, interested, AE Firms that did NOT respond to the AENETZERO sources sought, and that have the experience outlined in the attached sources sought document. If your firm already responded to the AENETZERO sources sought, please do not respond again unless you have changes you feel would enhance your previous response, as we already have input on the remaining objectives described in that response.  If interested, please review the full contents below and respond accordingly by 12:00 Noon, Central Time on Monday, March 24th, 2025 to the individuals listed below.

Additional information for both PEO MS and STARE can be found at the following website: https://www.army.mil/peoms

REQUIREMENT/ SPECIFICATIONS

The U.S. Army PEO MS, STARE Project Office, Passive Instrumentation Radars Product Office, Range Radar Replacement Program (RRRP) is seeking interested and qualified radar vendors for a forthcoming procurement project agreement of up to six instrumentation radars in the Medium Range Radar-Low Power (MRR-LP) configuration. Prototypes will support evaluation of critical range scenarios at White Sands Test Center (WSTC) and Yuma Test Center (YTC) which meet the requirements of the Performance Requirement Document (PRD) developed from the Army Test and Evaluation Command&rsquo;s (ATEC) Test Capability Requirement Document (TCRD) and Addendum. Currently, the PRD, draft or otherwise, is under development and not available.

The most qualified vendor(s) will leverage upon a prototype or similar system at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5 or higher. The information submitted should address the vendor&rsquo;s efforts and progress made toward developing a radar system with the following characteristics/capabilities: System must be unclassified, Risk Management Framework (RMF) compliant, and operate in the C-Band spectrum frequency, tunable between 5.4 and 5.9 GHz. The system needs to independently initiate and maintain tracks on multiple objects (15) in a Wide (+/- 30 degrees) Field of View (both in azimuth and elevation). In clear weather (0.02 dB/km), the system must detect a 6-inch sphere (-17.4 dBsm non-fluctuating object) at a range of 45 Km within a 10 msec coherent processing interval with a 99% probability of detection and a probability of false alarm of 10-5. In clear weather, the system must track a -17.4 dBsm non-fluctuating object at a range of 23 Km to a total accuracy (including both bias and noise errors) of 0.3 mrad within 0.5 seconds from the start of object acquisition at an elevation angle greater than 8 degrees to minimize the effects of multipath and clutter.

b9969ffbcfaf4c97a55a3114040c6615,W912HQ25R0007,Corps Water Management System (CWMS) Database Authorization,"This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.603 &ndash; Streamlined Solicitation for Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and FAR Part 13 procedures. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Proposals are being requested. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2025-03, dated 03 JAN 2025. 



Background:

The mission of the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Institute for Water Resources (IWR) Hydrologic Engineering Center (HEC) is to serve as the USACE Center of Expertise in the technical areas of surface and groundwater hydrology, river hydraulics and sediment transport, reservoir system analysis and a number of other closely associated technical subjects. HEC&#39;s primary goal is to support the nation in its water resources management responsibilities by increasing USACE&rsquo;s technical capability in hydrologic engineering and water resources planning and management. Additionally, HEC provides services to other Federal, state, local and international agencies engaged in these technical areas.



The Corps Water Management System (CWMS) is the Army Information System (AIS) that supports and enhances the decision-making process for the USACE water management mission. USACE is responsible for round-the-clock monitoring and operation of approximately 600 reservoir, lock and dam, and other water control projects. This responsibility also expands, during flood control operations, to approximately 120 additional Section 7 (Non-USACE) projects.



The focus of this contract is on the database and API components of our CWMS system.  CWMS is currently going through a transition from maintaining 32 independent, and geographically isolated systems, that feed into a public only central database, to a &quot;single&quot; cloud-based system that will contain all data, both public and private. Part of this transition is merging the multiple District databases into an Oracle RDS instance with an HTTP REST API called CWMS-Data-API (CDA). Previous to this decision, much of the data authorization was done within each individual database so that appropriate data constraints could be implemented while allowing District applications to access Oracle directly. The CWMS Database Schema (CWMS DB) has thus made heavy use of session contexts and the Oracle Virtual Private Database (VPD) system to provide appropriate authorization. Due to changes in technology, a more appropriate model of authorization needs to be adopted.



Requirement:



The objective of this contract is to develop a detailed plan on how to implement the Authorization Scheme into the CWMS Data API and then implement the created plan. This will include a review of our current data Schema and API to determine the best path forward. After the initial review, the following objectives will be required for the accomplishments of this contract.



1.         ability to authorize read permissions to data objects in the database

2.         ability to authorize write permissions to data objects in the database

3.         ability to authorize delete permissions to data objects in the database

4.         ability to authorize create permissions to data objects in the database

            4.         DLA provides no funding for any offer submitted to this CSO.  DLA funding is only possible after a signed contract.



B.         Background:  DLA is the Department of Defense&rsquo;s logistics combat support activity.  DLA provides worldwide logistical support to the military services and other authorized customers, which may include civilian organizations and foreign countries.  Potential offerors may learn more about DLA at htts://www.dla.mil. 
 

C.         How to Submit a Solution Brief.




	Prior to the closing date of the published Area of Interest, electronically submit to the person identified in paragraph A.3. of this CSO an unclassified Solution Brief, utilizing the Solution Brief template at Attachment 1.
	 
	Mark as appropriate all parts of the Solution Brief considered proprietary.  By submitting a Solution Brief, the offeror agrees to DFARS 252.227-7016, Rights in Bid or Proposal Information.
	 
	The Solution Brief must &lsquo;stand alone&rsquo;.  While the Solution Brief may include references to outside materials, links to website, etc., DLA WILL NOT AND CAN NOT consider such material.  Similarly, DLA will not consider any accompanying slides, sales materials, integrated or outside videos, or the like sent with the Solution Brief.  DLA may reject, without further consideration, Solution Briefs sent with extraneous materials.





	Offerors may submit multiple Solution Briefs for each AOI.  While each Solution Brief may reference another Solution Brief, DLA WILL NOT AND CAN NOT consider that referenced Solution Brief in evaluating this submitted Solution Brief.   





	Solution Briefs&rsquo; prices and all other terms and conditions must remain valid for 180 calendar days from the submission date of the Solution Brief.




D.         How DLA Will Make Any Awards.



            1.         DLA will first review Solution Briefs for conformance with this CSO.  DLA will return Solution Briefs DLA finds not in conformance with this CSO.  The offeror may, if the date and time stated in the Area of Interest has not passed, re-submit a revised Solution Brief.  While DLA intends to complete this review diligently, DLA is under no obligation to complete this review soon enough for an offeror to submit a revised Solution Brief.  Therefore, offerors should submit their best, conforming, Solution Briefs.



            2.         For Solution Briefs both received before the closing time of CSO and AOI, and also conforming to the CSO, DLA subject-matter expert technical evaluators will evaluate the Solution Brief.  First, evaluators will evaluate Factor 1, Possibility of Funding, and rate the Solution Brief as either &ldquo;Funding Possible&rdquo; or &ldquo;Funding Not Possible&rdquo;.  If evaluated as &ldquo;Funding Not Possible,&rdquo; evaluators will not evaluate the Solution Brief further and DLA will notify the offeror.  If evaluated as &ldquo;Funding Possible,&rdquo; evaluators will continue their evaluations through the remaining factors, assigning each remaining factor one of the following ratings: &ldquo;Exceptional,&rdquo; &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; &ldquo;Acceptable,&rdquo; &ldquo;Marginal,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Unacceptable.&rdquo;  All evaluation factors are described below.



            a.   Factor 1: Possibility of Funding.  Does funding reasonably exist to fund the proposed solution?  Solutions with lower prices are favored.   



                        b.         Factor 2: Technical Feasibility.  How technically feasible is the proposed solution to an AOI, given the present state of the technology and science?  Solutions with a lower technological risk profile are favored. 



            c.   Factor 3: Responsiveness.  How responsive is the proposed solution to the AOI?  Solutions responsive to the problem identified in the AOI, without creating new problems, are favored.



            d.   Factor 4: Viability.  How viable is the proposed solution given existing organizational and regulatory environments?  Solutions compatible with existing DLA, DoD, and federal policies, processes, and procedures, are favored.



            e.   Factor 5: Desirability.  How desirable is the proposed solution to the eventual end-user?  Solutions easily adaptable, useful, and implementable are favored. 



      3.   After the above evaluation, the technical evaluators will then decide whether the solution proposed in the Solution Brief merits further consideration.  Note that while Solution Briefs are not evaluated against other Solution Briefs, DLA has limited funding and acquisition manpower and thus cannot pursue all otherwise meritorious Solution Briefs.  DLA also recognizes that industry resources in pursuing business with DLA are limited.  To the extent DLA must select between highly rated Solution Briefs to pursue further, DLA will aggregate the Factor 2 through 5 ratings together equally to discern the most highly rated Solution Briefs.  If further discernment is necessary amongst highly rated Solution Briefs, DLA will then additionally consider the Factor 2 through 5 ratings in order of importance, with Factor 2 being the most important, Factor 3 being the second most important, Factor 4 being the third most important, and Factor 5 being the fourth most important.  And if still additional discernment is necessary, DLA will then consider the price proposed in the Solution Brief and select for further consideration the lowest priced Solution Brief.



      4.   If the technical evaluators decide a proposed Solution Brief merits further consideration, technical evaluators will decide whether to further consider the proposed solution via a Pitch, Full Proposal, or both.  Technical evaluators may also decide a on Pitch or Full Proposal, or both, are unnecessary, and refer a to Solution Brief for negotiation of a possible award as described in paragraph 5. 



            a.   Pitch: DLA would invite the offeror to &lsquo;pitch&rsquo; the offeror&rsquo;s proposed solution in a presentation, whether via a remote meeting, a face-to-face meeting, or other mutually agreeable means.  DLA will advise the offeror of the parameters of the Pitch at that time.  Offerors may propose different parameters; however, the final decision rests with DLA, as represented by the person noted in paragraph A(3).  During the Pitch, the parties may verbally discuss the proposed solution.  After the Pitch, DLA will decide whether an additional Pitch is desired, to request a full proposal, refer the offeror to the supporting contracting activity for award negotiations, or to terminate further consideration of the offer.   



            b.   Full Proposal: DLA would invite the offeror to submit a full proposal.  DLA will advise the offeror of the parameters of the full proposal at that time.  Offerors may propose different parameters; however, the final decision rests with DLA.  After receipt of the Full Proposal, DLA may communicate with the offeror about the Full Proposal, to better understand and review it.  After reviewing the Full Proposal, DLA will decide whether an additional or revised Full Proposal is desired, to request a &lsquo;Pitch&rsquo;, refer the offeror to the supporting contracting activity for award negotiations, or to terminate further consideration of the offer.    



      5.   If the technical evaluators refer an offeror to the supporting contracting activity for award negotiations, the supporting contracting activity will open negotiations with the offeror.  The conduct of such negotiations are within the discretion of the cognizant Contracting Officer or Agreement Officer, as the case may be, as bounded by applicable law and policy.  Offerors should note that the Contracting Officer, or Agreement Officer, is not required to award any contract and may close negotiations at any time at his or her discretion.  Offerors should further note that should any in negotiation resulting in an award, the prices awarded must be &lsquo;fair and reasonable&rsquo;. 



E.         Generally Applicable Information.



            1.         DLA provides no funds for partaking in any process described in this CSO.  Any funds will be disbursed only in accordance with a signed contract or other transaction agreement.



            2.         Should DLA award an other transaction agreement awarded under this CSO, DLA may later award a follow-on production contract or other transaction agreement without further competition, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. &sect; 4022. 



            3.         Note that Chapter 21 of Title 41, United States Code, applies to all submitted proposals and any awarded contract, whether awarded under the FAR or 10 U.S.C. &sect; 4022.



            4.         Note that DLA can only award to a responsible entity.  Please see FAR Part 9 for further information.

NOTICE: The following information is provided for situational awareness and is not required to respond to this Sources Sought.

All contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (www.SAM.gov) prior to award of a contract. All proposed contractors are highly encouraged to review FAR Clause 52.232-33 Payments by Electronic Funds Transfer &ndash; System for Award Management, which indicates &ldquo;All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT).&rdquo; Those not currently registered can obtain registration by going to the website http://www.SAM.gov. The process can usually be completed from 24 to 48 hours after submission. Contractors will need to obtain a Unique Entity Identifier (formerly DUNS number) for processing their registration. If you do not already have a Unique Entity Identifier, one can be obtained from http://www.SAM.gov. Refer to www.SAM.gov for information formerly found in CCR, EPLS, ORCA and FedReg.

Begin the registration process immediately to avoid a delay.

ALERT: You must submit a notarized letter appointing the authorized Entity Administrator before your registration will be activated. This requirement now applies to both new and existing entities. Effective 29 April 2018, the notarized letter process is now mandatory on all CURRENT registrants at SAM who have a requirement to update data on their SAM record.  The notarized letter is mandatory and is required before the GSA Federal Service Desk (FSD) will activate the entity&#39;s registration. 

Effective 29 June 2018, vendors creating or updating their registration can have their registration activated prior to the approval of the required notarized letter.  However, the signed copy of the notarized letter must be sent to the GSA Federal Service Desk (FSD) within 30 days of activation or the vendor risks no longer being active in SAM.

Vendors can check whether an account is active by performing a query by their CAGE or Unique Entity Identifier (known as DUNS). The new registration process may now take several weeks, so vendors are highly encouraged to begin registering as soon as possible to avoid any possible delays in future contract awards. Remember, there is no cost to use SAM. To find out additional information about the changes of the SAM registration process, contractors should visit the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) link located at the top of the SAM homepage (www.sam.gov).

PART II - TECHNICAL APPROACH

To confirm technically acceptability, the Offeror shall provide a technical approach to perform tasks specified in the attached Performance Work Statement (See Attachment 1).  Legibility, clarity, and coherence are very important. The narrative should include as specifically as possible, the actual methodology that will be used for accomplishing and satisfying the PWS&rsquo;s stated requirement(s). The Offeror shall assume that the Government has no prior knowledge of its capabilities, facilities, and experience, thus the Technical Approach will be solely based on the information presented in the Offeror&#39;s Technical Capability Narrative.

Addendum to FAR 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Products and Commercial Services

1. Evaluation:

By submission of its quote, the offeror agrees to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements. Failure to adhere to all solicitation requirements may result in an offer being determined unacceptable and ineligible for further evaluation.

Per FAR 13.106-1(a)(2), the Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

TECHNICAL ACCEPTABILITY

PRICE

BASIS FOR AWARD: In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(a)(2) offerors are notified that the award will be made to the lowest price offeror that meets the technical requirements contained within the PWS.  

It is the Government&rsquo;s intent to evaluate quotes and award a purchase order without interchanges with Offerors. Therefore, the Offeror&#39;s initial quote should contain the Offeror&#39;s best terms from a price, and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct interchanges if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.

52.212-2, Evaluation.

1. Technical Evaluation. The lowest priced quote received will be evaluated for technical acceptance.  If the lowest quote is accepted by the government, no further quotes will be evaluated.  If the lowest quote received is not technically accepted by the government, the next lowest priced quote received will be technically evaluated and so on until the lowest price received and accepted by the government is confirmed.  An award notice will be posted to sam.gov.

To confirm the capability, and therefore, acceptability, of the Offeror to meet the Government&rsquo;s requirements as outlined in PWS (Attachment #1), the Offeror shall submit with their quote, a clear, and concise Technical Capability Narrative that includes sufficient detail to substantiate the validity of the Offeror&rsquo;s stated claim(s) that they are able to meet the requirement. The narrative shall not simply rephrase, reiterate, or restate the Government&#39;s own language, but rather shall provide convincing rationale describing how the Offeror intends to fulfill the requirement. Legibility, clarity, and coherence are very important. The narrative should include as specifically as possible, the actual methodology that will be used for accomplishing and satisfying the requirements stated in the PWS. The Offeror shall assume that the Government has no prior knowledge of its capabilities, facilities, and experience, thus the technical evaluation will be solely based on the information presented in the Offeror&#39;s Technical Capability Narrative. The Offeror&rsquo;s Technical Capability Narrative must, at a minimum, address how the Offeror intends to meet the requirements of the PWS. 

To be considered technically acceptable, an Offeror shall provide past performance on two similar contracts within the past 5 years for work similar in scope to the PWS (Attachment #1).

Technical Evaluation Ratings:

Rating:

     Acceptable

         1. Submission clearly demonstrates technical capability to perform services defined in the PWS.

          2.  Submission shows past performance on two similar contracts within the past 5 years for work similar in scope to the PWS (Attachment #1).

     Unacceptable

         1. Submission does not clearly demonstrate technical capability to perform services outlined in the SOW.

         2. Submission does not show past performance on two similar contracts within the past 5 years for work similar in scope to the PWS (Attachment #1).

2 &ndash;Price Quote Evaluation

For price acceptance, all CLINs must have unit prices entered on Attachment #2 - Quote Template.  

Options. Per FAR 52.217-5, &ldquo;Evaluation of Options&rdquo;, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine a quote is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options

The Government intends to award a single purchase order in response to the RFQ. The Government reserves the right not to award a contract depending on the quality of the quotes submitted.

Clarifications conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the Contracting Officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for a quote revision. The Government intends to award a contract without discussions (while keeping with FAR Part 12 and 13). The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.

The Government reserves the right to make an award to one quoter or to make no award at all.

Under FAR part 13, a vendor who submitted a quote but did not receive the award may request a brief explanation of the basis for award decision. The request must be submitted to the Contracting Officer within three days of award notice in sam.gov.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.



The Naval Facilities Engineering Systems Command, Mid-Atlantic is seeking eligible small business firms capable of performing construction services for Design-Bid-Build (DBB) B300 Waterfront Machine Shop Roof &amp; HVAC Repair, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Kittery, Maine.



Building 300 is a manufacturing and machining facility. The existing roof system has surpassed its design/service life and has deteriorated to the point where there are significant leaks to the interior. The building interior is exposed to water infiltration due to these roof failures. The HVAC systems were installed during the original construction of the building between 1979 and 1984. No substantial changes have been made to the HVAC system since. The existing HVAC systems have depositions of lead dust within them.



The project will remove existing roofing which has exceeded its useful service life and provide for replacement with new roofing in-kind. The project also provides the removal of all air handling units and associated ductwork that conditions the industrial work areas. The project includes measures to contain lead dust that is known to be present within existing air handlers and ductwork. The project provides the addition of unit heaters to provide heat to the industrial work areas and dedicated outdoor air systems to provide fresh air to the space accompanied by destratification fans for occupant comfort.



Site improvements include utility construction and restoration of disturbed areas resulting from demolition activities. Utilities include electrical, and fire safety systems.



All service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small businesses (VOSB), certified HUB-Zone, certified 8(a), and women-owned small businesses (WOSB), and small businesses are encouraged to respond. Upon review of industry response to this Sources Sought Notice, the Government will determine whether a set-aside acquisition in lieu of full and open competition is in the Government&rsquo;s best interest. The contract will include FAR clause 52.219-14 Limitations on Subcontracting (DEVIATION 2021-O0008), which states that &ldquo;It will not pay more than 85 percent of the amount paid by the Government for contract performance, excluding the cost of materials, to subcontractors that are not similarly situated entities. Any work that a similarly situated entity further subcontracts will count towards the prime contractor&rsquo;s 85 percent subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded.&rdquo;



It is requested that interested small businesses submit to the Contracting Officer a capabilities package, to include the Sources Sought Contractor Information Form and Sources Sought Project Information Form, provided as attachments to this notice.



The Sources Sought Project Information Form shall be used to document a minimum of two (2) up to a maximum of five (5) relevant construction projects for the offeror that best demonstrates experience on projects that are similar in size, scope and complexity as listed below. Projects submitted for the offeror shall be completed within the past ten (10) years from the date of issuance of this Sources Sought. For the purposes of this evaluation, a relevant project is further defined as:



Size: A final construction cost of $15 million dollars or greater.



Scope: Renovation of an industrial facility involving repairing, replacing and removing interior elements including roof and HVAC.

Complexity: Each project submitted does not require demonstrated experience with all of the following complexity elements, but shall collectively demonstrate experience with all of the following elements:




	Experience with construction in and/or around occupied industrial facilities.
	Experience with sequencing and/or phasing requirements.
	Experience with projects in congested urban or industrial areas with limited construction laydown space and restricted access




Ensure that the project description clearly identifies whether the project is new construction or repair/renovation, addresses how the project meets the scope and complexity requirements as delineated above, and provides the final construction cost.



Please note that if you are responding as an 8(a) Mentor-Prot&eacute;g&eacute;, you must indicate the percentage of work to be performed by the prot&eacute;g&eacute;. A copy of the SBA letter stating that your 8(a) Mentor-Prot&eacute;g&eacute; agreement has been approved would be required with your proposal, if requested.



The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this project is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, with a small business size standard of $45,000,000. In accordance with DFARS 236.204(ii), the magnitude of construction for this project is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000.



THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.

This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Solicitation will be advertised as a Total Small Business set-aside under NAICS code 236220 &ndash; Commercial and Institution Building Construction , the small business size standard is $45.5 Million.



The Government anticipates awarding a single firm fixed price contract in accordance with the procedures outlined in FAR 15.3 &ndash; Source Selection.



REQUIREMENT BACKGROUND

In 2021 NIST completed a design contract with Burdette Koehler Murphy Associates Inc. (BKM) for work in Building 215 Cleanroom, part of the Advanced Measurement Laboratory (AML).  The AML was completed and occupied in 2005.  It is one of the most advanced laboratories of its type in the world.  The cleanroom facility within the AML complex houses an 1800 square meter cleanroom, of which 750 square meters is Class 100.  The Design that BKM completed includes:


	Perform Pre-demolition testing of mechanical equipment.
	Repair or replace ~70 variable air volume terminal units.
	Repair and perform diagnostics of existing control systems to confirm operation of existing dampers, valves and sensors.
	Replace ~54 existing airflow monitors.
	Install ~32 new exhaust air valves to control exhaust branch ductwork airflows.
	Repair or modify existing exhaust or supply ductwork.
	Replace all ~1200 existing terminal supply HEPA filters, repair supply connections, balance, and certification new HEPA filter.
	Rebalance air handling units, exhaust fans, exhaust tools.
	Perform rebalance of cleanroom to maintain proper room pressurization.
	Perform recertification of cleanroom.
	Verify and repair/replace capped ducts as needed.




When the design requirement originated, the NIST COR and customer agreed on one, 16-19 month shutdown for the work to be completed.  Since this decision was made, the customer requirement has changed; the construction contractor must limit outages by scheduling, planning, and containing cleanroom bays from adjacent spaces AND by working 24/7 starting Friday evenings and through the weekend until outages of cleanrooms are brought back online (maximum 1 week per outage)

GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS: Under the proposed Contract, the contractor will be required to provide the following construction services:



The Dutch Gap Aquatic Complex, IL - Sec. 206 project spans 785-acres in Antioch, Lake County, Illinois, on land owned by Lake County Forest Preserves. Intensive agriculture has led to the installation of drain tile networks, excavation of drainage ditches, and stream channelization, impacting natural hydrologic and other processes. Such impacts have enhanced flooding risks, minimized the amount of open space available for native plant and wildlife communities, diminished recreational opportunities, and disturbed natural processes and soils in the project area. The project area is further dominated by non-native and invasive plant species. The principal goal of the project is to restore stream, riparian, wetland, and buffering plant communities to provide habitat for migratory birds and local fish and wildlife. Restoration of aquatic ecosystems within the project area will reestablish hydroperiods and other hydrologic and hydraulic parameters to rehydrate former hydric soils to support critical wetland and riparian habitats. It will also reestablish native plant communities that will further diversify over time, resulting in greater quantity (acres) and quality of native plant communities.

TMPC subsystems include the Mission Distribution System (MDS), TMPC Communications System (TCOMMS), TCOMMS Communications Interface Processor (TCIP), TCIP Web Graphical User Interface (GUI), TMPC Distribution Manager (TDM), TMPC Operations &amp; Status Tool (TOST), Intelligence Situational Awareness Tool (ISAT), TMPC Enterprise Database (TED), Tasking Management Service (TMS), CPS Tasking Management (CTM) and CPS Mission Planning Package (MPP) Library software and hardware. This delivery order includes requirements analysis design, prototyping, development, integration, documentation, training, test, performance analysis, delivery, and installation while adhering to all cybersecurity standards and regulations.

This contract is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements. Peraton has been the sole developer and maintainer for multiple TMPC subsystems initially awarded pre-milestone II (B) in 1990 through a competitive selection as part of the TMPC upgrade program. Peraton has been providing continued development, delivery and sustainment necessary to improve system reliability, responsiveness, usability, and incorporation of changes required to maintain compatibility with other systems (i.e. changes to imagery formats, geo-spatial databases, etc.). Award of this follow on requirement to any source other than Peraton would result in unacceptable delays to planned and scheduled work already in progress for TMPC subsystems that must be accomplished to meet TMPC and TWS IOC milestones. Introducing a replacement for Peraton would be detrimental to the program&rsquo;s ability to effectively continue development, delivery and sustainment of currently deployed systems at 189 sites worldwide.

INTRODUCTION: 
 
The United States Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), on behalf of Program Executive Office Command, Control, Communications and Network (PEO C3N) is requesting industry feedback on the draft solicitation for Next Generation Command and Control (NGC2). 

Potential Offerors are encouraged to subscribe for real-time e-mail notifications when additional information is posted to the SAM.Gov website. 

DISCLAIMER:  

THIS DRAFT SOLICITATION IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.  RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY. 

PROGRAM BACKGROUND:  

NGC2 is a clean-sheet, fundamentally different approach for an Army-wide, data-centric transformation that enables our commanders to make more, faster, and better decisions than the enemy. NGC2 modernization is driven by continuous iteration of flexible requirements, vendor teaming and competition throughout the life cycle, and governance by an AFC product owner and ASA(ALT) program manager working together to plan and rapidly execute capability drops. This approach enables continuous integration and continuous deliver (CI/CD) of a secure, high performing, and adaptive technology stack for data and network architecture for varying operations in environments spanning from enterprise connected and cloud-enabled through austere and communication degraded. Delivering NGC2 will require process innovation across requirements, resourcing, acquisition and contracting.  

The Characteristics of Need, available separately on SAM.Gov and now includes a public NetModX update, are reflected in an open architecture, organized as a set of independent layers that rely on Government approved, non-proprietary APIs to interface and dialogue between them. Although independent, each layer is accessed by services that permit inter-layer functionality, such as orchestration that routes data differently in the transport layer depending on the availability of resources in the computer layer. The performance of each layer is improved through DevSecOps across the technology stack. The open interfacing between each layer provides continuous opportunity for technology insertion through competition and enables on-ramps and off-ramps for technology solution providers. At every echelon, the NGC2 ecosystem enables tactical edge survivability by allocating resources to optimize data orchestration and offer tailorability of commanders&rsquo; information needs

2012019558f640aca44d1229f00a709a,W912DS25BA003,"East Rockaway Inlet, New York, Federal Navigation Project","The U.S Army Corps of Engineers, New York District (USACE) proposes to perform maintenance dredging of East Rockaway Inlet, New York, Federal Navigation Project, including dredging the deposition basins. The dredged sand would be placed in a beneficial manner along the Far Rockaway Beach shoreline as beach nourishment between Beach 25th Street and Beach 49th Street. The proposed maintenance dredging would remove approximately 450,000 cubic yards of sand from the East Rockaway Inlet and its deposition basins. Dredging would be required to a depth of -14 feet Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) plus 2 feet allowable overdepth.


The purpose of the proposed work is to alleviate the effects of shoaling and maintain the authorized project dimensions, thereby providing safe and economical use of the East Rockaway Inlet by commercial and recreational boating interests while providing beneficial use of the dredged sand. Between maintenance operations, the by passed sand placed at the feeder beach would be carried by littoral drift to feed down drift beaches. The maintenance operation would thus serve to place sand trapped in the channel back into the normal littoral movement that naturally replenishes the western beaches, while maintaining a safe channel for navigation.


Maintenance dredging of the channel and deposition basins at East Rockaway Inlet will be accomplished by hydraulic dredge. The entire channel will generally not require maintenance dredging; only areas where shoaling has reduced the depth of the channel will require dredging. The dredged material would be required to meet all federal, state, and local criteria required by the government agencies having jurisdiction where the placement site is located.


The Contractor will be required to commence work within five (5) calendar days after the date of receipt by him of the notice to proceed, and to prosecute said work diligently and to complete the basic work ready for use not later than sixty (60) calendar days after the receipt by him of the notice to proceed (NTP). The contractor is required to maintain an integrated production of at least 12,000 cubic yards per calendar day.


The magnitude of this contract is between $10 million and $15 million. Plans and specifications for the subject project would be available in May 2025, with bid opening in June 2025. It is the intention of the government to award in July 2025 and issue the NTP in October 2025.


Liquidated Damages of $2,787.00 per calendar day of delay will be assessed to the contractor until all work under the contract is accepted as complete.


This project will be competed using full and open Unrestricted competition. It is anticipated that an IFB will be issued in May 2025 and the Bids will be due on or about 30 days later. The Specifications will be posted electronically via the Contract Opportunities at SAM.gov. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237990, Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction. The Small Business size standard for this code is $37.0 million.


Bids will be submitted to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Contracting Division, Room 16-300, 26 Federal Plaza, New York, NY 10278-0090.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:

For the purpose of market research, The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Vicksburg District requests letters of interest from qualified construction contractors capable of performing construction services for the following project:

Pike County, Arkansas, Narrows Dam, Intake Structure Replacement Project, Little Missouri River, Lake Greeson.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

Intake Structure Replacement Project

The Narrows Dam Intake Structure is planned to be replaced due to deterioration of the steel intake structure that supports the trash racks in front of the hydropower generating units. The work will only include the intake structure between Unit 1 &amp; 2 which will be denoted on the drawing attached. The structure is made up of steel beams and columns that were originally embedded into the concrete. The replacement structure will utilize post-installed concrete anchors in place of cast-in anchors. The elevation of the bottom of the structure is at EL. 478.0, and the top of the structure is at EL. 551.0. Underwater grouting may be required to ensure that the new structure is plumb. The concrete platform that the structure supports may be removed during construction. If removed, it shall be replaced with a precast concrete deck or a fiber reinforced polymer deck. Underwater welding may be required to install the structure and should follow AWS D3.6M:2017. Any welding not performed underwater will follow AWS D1.1:2020. The replacement structure must be coated prior to installation and may require touch-up coating underwater after installation. As an additional protection measure, a cathodic protection system should be included in the design and attached to the structure.

Work on the intake structure will require a planned lake pool deviation. The deviation is planned for a minimum of 120 days. The minimum lake pool elevation is EL. 534.0, and dive depths may reach up to 70 feet. Due to the size of the lake and the drainage area, lake levels may rise rapidly during construction. This may require discharge of water through the flood control gates, and in the case of an extreme event water may overtop the emergency spillway which has a crest at EL 563.0.

Access to the top of the dam is limited, and the size of the crane that may be placed on the dam is restricted to a 90-ton crane. This crane can only be placed in designated areas as outlined in Figure 1 below. Barges may be hauled in and launched upstream of the dam to provide a larger work platform.

The contractor must have at least 5 years of experience and have successfully completed a minimum of three (3) similar projects as outlined herein. Highlight any experience that would include underwater construction, installation of post-installed mechanical anchors, and steel structures.

Kings Island Turning Basin (KITB) is the primary turning basin for large ships, located adjacent to the Georgia Ports Authority docks.  KITB requires dredging to allow the loaded ships to freely turn when using the port.  About 1.6 million cubic yards of maintenance material is removed from the KITB annually.

Other contractors may be working for the Savannah District on the Savannah Harbor, to include within confined upland dredged material containment areas and designated staging areas.  If such work occurs, all dredging and placement activities shall be coordinated under the direction of the Contracting Officer.

The material dredged from the Savannah Inner Harbor shall be placed in confined upland disposal areas adjacent to the Savannah River. Savannah dredged material containment areas (DMCA) 1N, 2A, 12A, 13A, 13B, 14A, 14B and Jones Oyster bed Island are operated by the Corps for dredging purposes.  Access to these areas which are owned by a combination of the Georgia Department of Transportation and US Fish and Wildlife Service is coordinated through the Savannah District.

Environmental restrictions may limit the timing of dredging in the Savannah Inner Harbor.  The striped bass spawning window limits the timing of dredging above station 63+360 (river mile 12) for two weeks during period established annually by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources between 1 April and 15 May, and a dissolved oxygen window exists from 1 July through 30 September.  To protect sturgeon aggregation areas in the upper river, no dredging is allowed above station 105+500 from 1 May through 31 October. 

Maintenance material in certain reaches of the channel may contain cadmium (Cd) in levels significant enough require special placement in the DMCAs.  Sediments in those reaches will be tested by the Government prior to dredging.  If Cd is found in those sediments equal to or greater than established thresholds, options can be exercised to prescribe disposal of the sediments in specific DMCAs under special handling conditions.

Obstructions are objects or materials in the required side slope cross sections or in the existing ground surface which are unknown at the time of encounter by the dredge or identified by pre and post hydrographic surveys, and monthly condition surveys. Obstructions are objects which cannot be removed by a hydraulic pipeline dredge.  The Contractor may encounter obstructions during dredging operations and must remove the objects or materials to provide the required section as shown on the cross-section plates.  If the Contractor is performing maintenance dredging with a pipeline dredge, the dredge must act as a probe for obstructions.  The object removed will be the property of the Contractor unless it has been determined to be culturally significant. 

The base contract includes mobilization/demobilization, maintenance dredging, moves, and dive team personnel and equipment rental for obstruction removal.  Contract options include additional pumping considerations for placement of material in designated Cd disposal areas that may be dredged from reaches potentially containing levels of Cd that require special handling.

This project involves maintenance dredging in the Duluth-Superior Federal navigation channel located along the border of Wisconsin and Minnesota. The Contractor will be required to mobilize a dredge to the Duluth-Superior channel and perform mechanical dredging within the channel.  Dredging will be required within the following areas:

&bull;           Dredge Area 1: The mouth of the Duluth Entry

&bull;           Dredge Area 3: The Duluth Harbor Basin Northern Section near Rices Point

&bull;           Dredge Area 4: The Duluth Harbor Basin Southern Section near Rices Point

&bull;           Dredge Area 5: The northern reach of the Duluth Anchorage Area

The Dredging may also include options to perform additional dredging within the areas:

&bull;           Dredge Area 6: The East Gate Basin near Hearding Island

&bull;           Dredge Area 8: The southern reach of the East Gate Basin near Connors Point

&bull;           Dredge Area 11: The Superior Front Channel near Barkers Island

&bull;           Dredge Area 23: The South Channel Eastern Section near the C. Reiss Coal Dock

&bull;           Dredge Area 26: The South Channel Western Section near Hallet Dock No. 8

Dredged material from Dredge Areas 1, 3, &amp; 6 will be placed along Wisconsin Point adjacent to a closed former landfill between the Ordinary High Water Mark (OHWM) and the most landward 12 foot (ft) depth contour. The Contractor must have the equipment and ability to perform in-water mechanical dredging to the required depths, to transport and place material at the required placement area.

Placement at Wisconsin Point will require the implementation of various Best Management Practices (BMPs) to ensure turbidity is kept within state-approved limits at the placement site. BMPs will also be implemented to limit debris being placed along Wisconsin Point. Placement at Wisconsin Point is unrestricted for hydraulic or mechanical placement. An allowable transfer box location will be provided to allow for hydraulic placement operations and will be located adjacent to the southernmost limits of the Federal navigation channel (near Allouez Bay). An allowable pipeline path (for hydraulic placement) and staging area will be provided near a closed former landfill on Wisconsin Point, adjacent to the placement site. If the pipeline access route is utilized, the Contractor will be responsible for ensuring Wisconsin Point Road and Allouez Bay (pedestrian, vehicular and watercraft traffic) remains accessible to the public through the life of the project. A couple land-based staging area will be provided to accommodate the potential use of booster pumps, if the contractor elects to hydraulically place material at Wisconsin Point.

Dredged material from Dredge Areas 4, 8, 11, 23, &amp; 26 will be placed within the Erie Pier CDF. Placement will be restricted to mechanical means and the contractor will be required to wash the material being placed in the CDF with water from the existing settling ponds in order to separate and stockpile sand from the rest of the dredged material.

The required dredging depths will be approximately 27 ft to 33 ft below Low Water Datum (LWD) depending on the location within the harbor. The material is expected to be a mix of (predominantly) sand, with the potential of minor debris typical in an active harbor. The quantity of dredged material in the contract may range from approximately 121,000 cubic yards to 196,000 cubic yards.

The Government will not pay for information, materials, and/or demonstrations received in response and is in no way obligated to respondents by or for any information received.

BACKGROUND, SCOPE, AND CAPABILITY REQUIREMENTS:

A few years ago, the ATF recognized the need to integrate Team Awareness Kit (TAK) into our day-to-day operations, as it provided an unmatched situational awareness capability.  TAK Servers were added to connect isolated teams and to federate with other government agencies.

The anticipated contract type is an IDIQ type contract with Firm, Fixed Price delivery orders.



ATF is looking for a company to perform the following:

Installation and maintenance of Team Awareness Kits.



Delivery/Performance Time Sixty (60) days from award or period of performance (POP) is one (1) year base and four (4) one-year ordering periods, plus FAR clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services for an additional 6 months if necessary.



Product/Service Description:  Installation and maintenance of Team Awareness Kit software in the ATF environment.

NAICS: 541519 Other computer related services

Product or Service Code: 7030, Information Technology Software



THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  This is a market research tool.

If you are an interested business, ATF would appreciate your assistance in providing a Statement of Capabilities to include the following:



1) Full business name and address.

9) No pricing and or cost data and or information should be included with your response.



If there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability among small business contractors, a key factor in determining if an acquisition will be a small business set-aside is that two or more potential small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the effort, as defined in FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate, and your company anticipates submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for a small business set-aside, please provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc.  If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used.  If this effort is not set-aside for small business, small business utilization will be considered.  Large and small businesses should provide a reasonable expectation for small business utilization as a percent of total contract value as well as supporting rationale for the recommended percentage.

Submissions are to be no more than 10 pages and no less than 12 point font, in Time New Roman.

8c73bd83156c4405aa9aeef2bf27f5db,W912DW25Z157S,FY25 Willapa Bay Maintenance Dredging,"This Synopsis/Pre-Solicitation Notice is ONLY A NOTIFICATION that a solicitation is anticipated and forthcoming. All questions regarding this Synopsis/Pre-Solicitation should be submitted in writing to the Point of Contact(s) indicated below.

Construction Project:

Pre-solicitation Notice Number: W912DW25Z157S

The magnitude of construction is estimated to be between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.

The resulting contract will be firm-fixed-price.

FY25 Willapa Bay Maintenance Dredging Project Details:

USACE Seattle District has a need for a construction dredging, project entitled FY25 Willapa Harbor Maintenance Dredging, Willapa Harbor, WA at three federal navigation features in Willapa Bay, Washington: (1) the entrance to Tokeland Marina; (2) the entrance channel to Nahcotta; and (3) the Bay Center entrance channel and basin. The work is anticipated to begin in July 2025 and all in-water work must be completed by 15 Feb 2026.

The project will require dredging via mechanical (clamshell) means to remove approximately 180,000 CY of accumulated sediment across the three project features. The minimum required dredging depth varies from -10 ft (Bay Center and Nahcotta) to -15 ft MLLW (Tokeland).

In addition, dredging of approximately 10,000 CY may be required to a minimum depth of -9 ft MLLW in the Palix River thalweg to ensure sufficient water depths for the dredge, scow, and tugboats to transit to/from Bay Center and the disposal sites. This amount has the potential to change due to the dynamic nature of the Palix River at its confluence with Willapa Bay. 

Dredged material will be disposed via bottom-dump barge at the Cape Shoalwater and/or South Channel open-water disposal locations within Willapa Bay.  The work window varies by project features, but ranges between 16 July through 15 Feb of any given calendar year for each specific project feature. The in-water work windows are as follows:

&bull;           Tokeland Marina: 16 July 2025 through 15 February 2026

&bull;           Nahcotta: 16 July 2025 through 01 February 2026

&bull;           Bay Center and Palix River: 16 July 2025 through 30 September 2025

Access to/from Willapa Bay requires transit of the Willapa Bar, an unmaintained and unprotected entrance from the Pacific Ocean with dynamic shoals, strong tidal currents, and challenging weather conditions.  Furthermore, marine transit within Willapa Bay between project features and dredged material disposal sites requires transit through similar unmaintained and often shallow water depths. Potential risk exists for vessel groundings or accidents. Aids-to-Navigation across the Willapa bar have been removed as they are no longer reliable due to dynamic shoaling conditions. In all locations, shoals are present and shift depending on environmental conditions including tides and storms. This performance window includes the worst season for storm and marine conditions.  Contractors should expect difficult mobilization, demobilization, and construction conditions.

See the forthcoming solicitation for details about bid submission and virtual bid opening. The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990, Dredging and Surface Cleanup, and the associated small business size standard is $37,000,000 in average annual receipts.

The solicitation, and resulting contract includes, by reference, a Construction Task Catalog&reg; (CTC) produced and maintained by Gordian.

All unit prices are based on local labor, material and equipment prices to perform the activity. The solicitation, and resulting contract also includes Technical Specifications which set forth the quality of workmanship and quality of materials required for the service tasks. Offering Firms responding to this solicitation will propose Adjustment Factors to be applied to the CTC Schedule. The Adjustment Factors will apply to each unit price in the CTC, except for any line item specifically noted otherwise. As projects are initiated by the Postal Service, the contractor will participate in a Joint Scope Meeting, at which the scope of work for the individual project will be explained to the contractor, and give the contractor an opportunity to ask questions, inspect the site and make recommendations with regards to means and methods, scheduling and other aspects of the project as circumstances dictate.

The Postal Service will then prepare a Detailed Scope of Work and issue a Request for Proposal to the contractor. The contractor will prepare a Price Proposal Package for the project including, among other items, a Price Proposal and a schedule. In general, the Price Proposal will be prepared by identifying the proper construction tasks from the CTC and multiplying the pre-set unit prices by the quantity required and by the appropriate Adjustment Factors. The Postal Service will review the Price Proposal Package and may request changes. Once an acceptable Work Order Package has been submitted, the Postal Service Contracting Officer will issue a Notice to Proceed for the project.

A separate work order will be issued for each project. A work order will contain a Detailed Scope of Work, the project completion time, and the price to be paid for the work. The work order price shall be a lump sum, firm fixed price based on the sum total of the unit prices for the completion of the Detailed Scope of Work.

The United States Postal Service (USPS) has partnered with Gordian, Inc. to provide management of its IDIQ Ordering Agreement construction program. In this role, Gordian provides support to USPS in the administration of the program, including preparing Construction Task Catalogs and related technical specifications, providing information management systems and licenses to contractors, training to contractors, consulting services to USPS, and assisting with proposals or work order development.

The project is anticipated to reduce the risk of levee failure from an erosion related levee breach for approximately 1,000 feet along the Sacramento River. The project is anticipated to include several erosion protection measures located above and below the average low flow water surface elevation (~7 feet NAVD88 as defined) using rock bank protection to include a 3.5-foot-thick lens of launchable Graded Stone C below the water surface to protect the bank from scour and erosion as well as Graded Stone C extended above the water surface to the top of the bank under the Pioneer Bridge section. The project is anticipated to include a 3.5-foot-thick lens of soil-rock mix above the water surface to protect the bank from wave wash generated by boat wakes and wind waves, demolition and removal of the existing upper bank material under the I-80 Pioneer Bridge section to provide a suitable foundation for the Graded Stone C, and In-stream Woody Material (IWM) to be placed below the water line to create in-stream cover for fisheries throughout the seasons and provide flow deflection along the bank.

The Government anticipates construction work will be performed in the Summer and Fall of 2025 / from June 2025 to October 2025. In-water work may only be performed from 1 July 2025 to 31 October 2025. All work / construction activities must be complete by 180 days from Notice to Proceed.

ee4e079e66614c1487f07cf82a95c1ea,W912ES25QA005,"De-Water Maintenance By-Pass at Orwell Dam, MN","SCOPE OF WORK &ndash; Orwell Dam By-pass Flow

1.  Project Description

The Saint Paul District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has issued this solicitation for by-pass services at Orwell Dam near Fergus Falls, MN.  The USACE operates Orwell Dam for flood risk management, water supply, fish and wildlife management, water quality, and recreation.  This contract is to supply necessary services and equipment to operate and maintain a 80 cubic feet per second (cfs) by-pass flow from pool to the tailwater around the dam control structure during its dewatering.  The by-pass system will ensure a minimal flow downstream and to facilitate a successful dewatering inspection and if needed repairs to the stilling basin.



The Contractor is responsible for supplying, installing, operating, and maintaining a complete by-pass flow system to maintain a minimum flow of 80cfs. The by-pass system shall include the minimum number of pumps to sustain a constant minimum flow of 80cfs throughout the dewatering. The Contractor shall provide all pumps, generators, piping, transportation of equipment to and from the site, labor associated with the setup, and all costs related to by-pass operations, fuel and maintenance.



All work will occur at Orwell Dam near Fergus Falls, MN, and may commence after September 2, 2025, Monday to Friday, between 0800-1700, excluding Federal Holidays. The by-pass system must be operational no later than 8:00am on September 15, 2025 and run continuously until 3pm on September 19, 2025. The by-pass system removal can start after September 22, 2025, between 0800-1700, and shall be completed by September 26, 2025.





2. Project Scope Statement

The following are project requirements:




	Maintain a minimum flow capacity of 80cfs.
	Generator: The Contractor must provide a generator capable of powering all pumps. The generator shall be located at the top of the dam and the location shall be coordinated with the government. The contractor will be required to fuel and maintain the generator during operations.
	Piping: The Contractor shall provide leak-free piping from the pumps to the downstream discharge point, capable of withstanding pumping forces. The length of piping required is approximately 350ft as shown by the orange line in Figure 1. Contractor shall verify the required pipe length during the post award site visit.
	Pumps: The Contractor shall supply operational submersible pumps capable of maintaining a minimal flow of 80cfs. Submerging the pumps to the bottom of the control structure slab will result in approximately a minimum of 15ft of water. The distance from the bottom of the control structure to the top of the dam is approximately 43ft. See Figure 1 (SOW Attachment 1) for cross-section.
	Location: Staging and setup shall be on the north side of the dam. The exact placement of pumps, generator, and piping shall be coordinated with the Government to avoid hindering dewatering operations, bulkhead installation, and surrounding dam instrumentation. Reference to Government-provided drawings should be made and Figure 2 (SOW Attachment 1) which outlines the by-pass layout during the 2003 dewatering.




3. The Base of Scope of Work

The Contractor shall set up the by-pass system around the concrete control structure. The upstream pool is accessible from the top of the embankment dam (elevation: 1080) on the north side and pumps can be placed on the upstream concrete control structure slab (elevation: 1037). The Contractor shall install the pumps, generator, and piping to maintain a minimum constant flow of 80cfs. The Contractor shall provide a suitable crane and all necessary equipment for setting up pumping operations, including piping lines. The Contractor shall utilize a generator as a power source since availability at the site is not guaranteed.

The Government will coordinate with the Contractor regarding pump and piping locations to ensure correct placement without obstructing bulkhead installation and not impact instrumentation that is located.

4. Environmental Protection:

Environmental protection is the prevention/control of pollution and habitat disruption that may occur to the environment during construction. The control of environmental pollution and damage requires consideration of land, water, and air; biological and cultural resources; and includes management of visual aesthetics; noise; solid, chemical, gaseous, and liquid waste; radiant energy and radioactive material as well as other pollutants.

These services will support the ISMT Operations and Maintenance. Fleet Marine Force and Marine Force Reserves ISMT systems are located both inside the Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS). 

The ISMT Systems are interactive audio/video simulators that provide network capable training in marksmanship, weapons employment, indirect fire, and tactical decision- making. The ISMT systems incorporate the use of simulated organic Infantry Battalion Table of Equipment (T/E) weapons to enable Marines and Sailors to train and rehearse skills for marksmanship, weapons employment, tactical engagement, and tactical decision making. Up to three ISMT systems can be networked together and used simultaneously. When networked together, the configuration is commonly referred to as an Infantry Squad Trainer (IST). In this configuration, 15 firing points for known and unknown distance ranges can be supported, with up to 24 assigned weapons while executing scenarios within a virtual battle space. The ISMT also supports Crew Served Weapons (CSWs) employment training to augmenting live fire training with simulated qualification tables of fire, added repetitions of target engagements allowing for further Standing Operating Procedure (SOP) refinement, and simulated collective environments where CSWs support infantry maneuver. 

The Offeror shall manage the configuration of the training system to ensure the system and system components are using the correct software baseline.

NO QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED OR ACCEPTED WITH THIS RFI. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR QUOTES. Respondents will NOT be notified of the results of this notice. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this notice or any follow-up information requested.

Market Research is being performed pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10 to identify businesses capable of performing the functions described herein.

SUMMARY OF SCOPE

The Contractor shall establish accurate Construction Cost Data Special Location Factors for use in the Indian Health Service&rsquo;s (IHS) Facility Budget Estimating System (FBES).  These Location Factors are located within the Lower 48 States and Alaska.

Special Location Factors are used within the FBES to account for the variation in construction costs in different geographic locations.  Each geographic location where IHS facilities are located and constructed has its own location factor and represents a deviation from a national average.  When estimating the construction cost for a specific project in a specific location, the FBES adjusts the base unit construction costs (the cost per square foot to construct various kinds of IHS facilities) by multiplying them by the location factor wherein the project is located.

The primary source of Standard Location Factors is the Marshall &amp; Swift Valuation Service (MVS) Section 99, Local Multipliers Data.  The MV factors for Class A construction are used for this purpose. The Contractor will need to obtain a subscription to the MVS reference books in order to complete the work.

Contractor shall conduct the necessary market research for development of Special Location Factors. Unless prior approval is obtained, travel will not be expected nor required.

The type of work to be performed will be categorized under PSC code R499, Support- Professional: Other and NAICS code 541990 All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services with a size standard of $19.5M.

The Government anticipates award of a single Requirements type contract (per FAR 16.503) that includes one base year and four option years.

USMC Prepositioning Plans and Data Support Requirement Overview/Scope

Each Maritime Prepositioning Ship cycles through Jacksonville, Florida every 42-48 months to conduct what is known as the MPS Maintenance Cycle (MMC). The process required to properly plan for the execution of the MMC is an 18-24 month deliberate effort that begins with guidance produced by Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC} Plans Policies and Operations (PP&amp;O), followed by Planning Parameters and Factors provided by HQMC Installations and Logistics (l&amp;L) then lastly, operational or tactical guidance from the Marine Forces (MARFORs) or Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) commanders. Myriad tailoring, equipment fielding and load planning conferences take place in order to ensure the required information necessary to build the required plans in support of the MMC is known.

The Plans and Data Support (P&amp;DS) contract provides the full range and depth of logistics services and software systems support for the Marine Corps Prepositioning Program (MCPP} which includes the MPF Program, MCPP&shy; N and MCPP-PHIL. The Contractor shall provide services and products in support of the nine major areas: Plans Management, Marine Corps Prepositioning Programs Plans/Tailoring, MPF Maintenance Cycle Planning, Data Mangement, Information Systems, Automated Identification Technology, Software Maintenance and Support, Field Service Representative (FSR) Operations and Exercise/Contingency Support. In addition to prepositioning support, this contract provides operational logistics automated information technology capabilites in support of logistics for Marine Corps, Department of Defense (DoD) units, and other Government Agencies when required. This support shall enable the operating forces to rapidly and successfully conduct Arrival &amp; Assembly (A&amp;A) operations and when required, support to reconstitution efforts upon completion of assigned missions. It was also support day-to-day operations within the logistics communities, both operational and supporting.

The Government will provide the required information and documentation to the P&amp;DS contractor to facilitate the development of the various MPSRON/ship&#39;s plans. The development of the ships planning documents is an iterative and evolving process due to the potential for changes in equipment configuration, ship alterations, defense strategies and Concepts of Employment (COE), creating the need for close coordination between the government Plans Branch and the P&amp;DS contractor. The P&amp;DS contractor also supports tailoring requirements associated with the equipment and supplies that are planned to be prepositioned as a part of the MPF, MCPP-N, and MCPP-PHIL programs.

The Contractor shall utilize current and future government-owned information management systems, databases, and software systems to review, download, manage, store, and modify MPS planning related data as applicable. The existing systems Integrated Computerized Deployment System (ICODES) and Sea Service Deployment Module (SSDM) contain transportation and configuration data. Total Force Structure Management System (TFSMS) and Global Combat Support System Marine Corps (GCSS-MC), contain supply and inventory information, respectively. Contractor may be required to access TFSMS and GCSS-MC to validate allowances and inventory information to facilitate the development of planning documents. Some MCPP entities, such as MCPP-N, utilize systems that have unique interface requirements. MCPP-N currently uses the Norway Equipment Inventory Management System (NEIMS) for in-country data management; however, a current initiative to migrate NEIMS data to a Marine Corps LOGAIS will address this issue. If this migration has not taken place prior to award of this contract, the P&amp;DS contractor shall interface with Norwegian Defense Logistics Organization/Marine Expeditionary Brigade (NDLO/MEB) to facilitate the conversion of NEIMS Limited Data (text file or spreadsheet) into the current Marine Corps LOGAIS. The conversion of NEIMS Limited Data shall be imported by utilizing the government owned MCPIC software. Data management for the MCPP-PHIL program is in its infancy and will be established during this period of performance. The following information management systems are significant to meet the MPS, MCPP-N and MCPP-PHIL prepositioning requirements:


	Marine Corps Platform Integration Center (MCPIC). MCPIC proper is a government-owned web-based LOGAIS that consists of multiple applications that support the prepositioning planning and execution processes. The P&amp;DS contractor shall maintain and provide system support for MCPIC prepositioning modules, and interface maintenance upgrades as required and directed by the COR for technical matters. Ensure all software maintenance is performed in accordance with Marine Corps Cybersecurity regulations and are coordinated with MCSF-BI S-6 prior to being implemented. Changes to approved CCB system revisions/enhancements are required to be presented and approved by the MCPIC CCB. MCPIC is a government-owned web-based LOGAIS that consists of multiple applications which provides cradle-to-grave support of MMC prepositioning planning and execution processes. The P&amp;DS contractor shall utilize the MCPIC platform for MPF maintenance cycle planning and execution management using the Mission Framework, Prepositioning Objective, and Prepositioning Planning modules; automate the capture of Level VI transportation data (Level VI detail describes nested cargo or cargo that is contained in another equipment item(s)); automate the inventory tracking and management of all prepositioned equipment and supplies throughout the maintenance and afloat phases of the MMC; and interface AIT information into accountable property systems of record (APSRs).  (Note: As a government owned system, the government retains exclusive rights to intellectual property resulting from any enhancement activities by the P&amp;DS contractors that is funded by the government.) The P&amp;DS contractor shall maintain and provide system support for MCPIC.  The contractor shall maintain MCPIC&rsquo;s prepositioning systems interfaces and update as approved by the CCB and directed by the KO. The contractor shall ensure all software maintenance is performed in accordance with Marine Corps Cybersecurity regulations and the baseline versions are coordinated with MCSF-BI S-6 (or other entities as established by the government) prior to being placed into production. Expansion of MCPIC may require enhancements and upgrades. Potential future projects shall be vetted and approved by the CCB. The following is a listing of CCB projects being considered: Production, Planning, control and Prepositioning Planning module, and Mission Framework.
	Integrated Computerized Deployment System (ICODES). ICODES is a government provided web-based Computer Aided Design (CAD) software program that is used to build ship and air load plans. The Contractor shall conduct training and provide help-desk support to all Blount Island MPF personnel that require access to the system. ICODES integrates and interfaces with MCPIC.
	Integrated Placement and Registration of Identified Materials and Equipment (iPRIME) Suite. The government developed iPRIME Suite consists of the following applications: iMARK, iTRACK, iPACK and Inventory Manager. The iPRIME Suite is an application hosted in MCPIC. These tools are web based and mobile applications that integrate automated identification technology (AIT) to enhance supply chain business processes. It facilitates the Item Unique Identification (IUID) marking and registration of qualified military equipment. It maintains an IUID data interface with the USMC Temporary Data Store (TDS) and the DOD IUID Registry. iPRIME suite also facilitates the use of passive radio frequency identification (pRFID) technology by encoding and associating tags to military equipment and supplies. Once the equipment is tagged, it is used to maintain asset identification and visibility, conduct inventories, and track equipment movement and distribution. Using the Playbook functionality, the iPRIME Suite supports the MPF Arrival and Assembly (A&amp;A) phase of operations by providing the Ground Commander real-time tracking of equipment distribution to the using units. iPRIME suite contains middleware for AIT device management and control. AIT devices range from fixed pRFID readers to real-time tracking location system (RTLS) technologies. It provides automated notification to functional managers in the event a failure occurs. iPRIME Mobile (part of the iPRIME Suite) is designed to operate on tablets, mobile devices, handheld scanners and laptops. The iPRIME suite integrates with both Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server. It is government owned software and has a Type Accreditation with a complete Authority to Operate / Authority to Connect (ATO/ATC) on the Marine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN). The Contractor shall ensure all software maintenance and enhancements made to iPRIME are designed in accordance with Marine Corps Cybersecurity regulations and are coordinated with MCSF-BI CCB and S-6 prior to being implemented.

Funding has been removed for this project due to budget drawdown. The Invitation for Bid is now cancelled. This listing will be inactivated tomorrow. Thank you for everyone that attended the site visit and I apologize for the wasted effort. We just received notice of the requirement cancellation today. 

UPDATE 26 February 2025: 

Questions are now due 6 March 2025, end of day. Submit questions to Brandon.Jump@dla.mil. 

Bids are now due 19 March 2025, end of day. See Attachment 4 - Continuation Page_rev1. 

Bids shall be submitted to show BASE BID Pricing as well as BASE BID PLUS OPTION 1 pricing. The Government will select whether we will proceed with the BASE BID pricing or the BASE BID PLUS OPTION 1 pricing. There will be no ala carte selections between the two bids. 

QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS: 


	Performance and Payment Bonds: Could you confirm the exact timeline for submitting these after the contract award? &ndash; 5 days from contract award.
	DBIDS Pre-enrollment: Are subcontractors required to complete individual DBIDS registrations, or can they be registered under the prime contractor? &ndash; no, every individual requires DBIDS enrollment.
	Bid Guarantee: Are there any alternative forms of bid guarantee acceptable beyond the 20% bid price cap?&mdash;no
	Work Hour Extensions: The solicitation notes 7 AM - 5 PM work hours&mdash;is there a process for requesting extended work hours if necessary? -- yes, but on a limited need basis as determined by the work and schedule
	Liquidated Damages: Are there any conditions or scenarios under which the $500 per day penalty may be waived? &ndash; no
	Emergency Utility Cutovers: The contract requires 14 days&rsquo; notice for utility interruptions&mdash;is there a process for expediting emergency cutovers? &ndash; no
	Submission via DOD SAFE: Is the proposal required to be submitted through DOD SAFE, or is this platform strictly for bid submission? -- DOD SAFE is for bid submission. Any docs that you would submit with your bid may go through there (ex/ bid price document as well as non-price proposal documents). That is the official place to submit your docs, because it timestamps the submissions with both the government&rsquo;s notice and your notice.
	Submission Requirements: If the proposal must be uploaded to DOD SAFE, please confirm any specific instructions, required documents, or additional steps necessary to comply. -- I will annotate contractor attendance at the site visit, as well as make an update to SAM asking for industry participants to reach out to me with their email addresses so I can open the DOD SAFE link for them to submit bid docs. There are limits on how early I can do that with DOD SAFE, so the link will not be opened until after the site visit.
	Deadline Compliance: Is there a specific cut-off time for submission on March 19, 2025, or will proposals be accepted until 11:59 PM ET? -- The due date is 11:59pm Eastern. You have the full day to submit bids through DOD SAFE. If there are any changes to this plan, I will notify everyone publicly via SAM, and likely offer an extension for fairness.
	Confirmation of Receipt: Once submitted, will we receive an official acknowledgment, and who should we contact if we encounter any technical issues? -- Yes, DOD SAFE will sent confirmations to both you and I. This is the most transparent and mutually accountable process that I was able to find.

c9bab03fab4747ada2c365d2fed044e1,RFP-2025-10206,Maintenance of Accreditation Program for Guidelines Home Energy Professionals Project,"The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is a national laboratory owned by
the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). NREL is the only federal laboratory dedicated to
research, development, commercialization, and deployment of renewable energy and
energy efficiency technologies. NREL is managed and operated for DOE&rsquo;s Office of
Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy by The Alliance for Sustainable Energy
(Alliance), the &ldquo;M&amp;O Contractor&rdquo;.


The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP)
reduces energy costs for low-income households by increasing the energy efficiency of
their homes, while ensuring their health and safety. To support WAP, the Guidelines for
Home Energy Professionals (GHEP) was established, which includes Standard Work
Specifications for Home Energy Upgrades (SWS), Home Energy Professional (HEP)
certifications, and accreditation of energy-efficiency training programs.


Training and certifications for workers in the residential building retrofit market have
experienced rapid growth in recent years. The competencies gained by workers who
complete training and the scope and depth of training curriculum varies widely, leading
to uncertainty in the marketplace as to 1) what competencies are necessary for a person
to adequately perform a specific job, and 2) which trainers and training programs are
qualified according to those competency requirements.


Due to these market challenges, DOE tasked the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory (NREL) with developing and maintaining GHEP resources including the SWS
and accrediting HEP Energy Auditor (EA) certification to the International Standards
Organization (ISO) 17024:2012 standard. NREL has also been tasked with leading the
development and maintenance of Job Task Analyses (JTA) for all HEP schemes which
include single-family Crew Leader, Energy Auditor, Quality Control Inspector (QCI), and
Multifamily EA and QCI. JTAs are used to analyze and identify tasks within a job role
and form the basis of accredited training toward the HEP certifications.


To support the HEP workforce and adhere to the DOE Quality Work Plan (QWP)
(https://www.energy.gov/scep/quality-work-plan-requirements), certified trainers and
accredited training programs must be available. NREL is tasked with ensuring that WAP
training centers and trainers maintain their credentials, and that additional training
centers and trainers can be credentialed by an accredited standards developing
organization.


OBJECTIVE
The objective of this work effort is to ensure high-quality, third party validated training
and trainers are available and remain available to the WAP network and to increase
the national availability of accredited WAP training by supporting new and existing
Weatherization Training Center (WTC) credential holders with accreditation and
certification services.

Once the visitor/contractor is vetted and approved for installation access, Security &amp; Emergency Services will notify the sponsor that the visitor/contractor can go to the DSCR Visitor Center to obtain his/her pass.  At the Visitor Center, the visitor provides the barcode and code provided earlier in the process and completes the credentialing process.

The evaluation will consider the education, training, registration and overall relevant experience of the firm&#39;s key personnel.

Provide a minimum of one (1) individual / up to a maximum of two (2) individuals per discipline for each of the key personnel disciplines identified below.  Identified key personnel will be more highly evaluated if the individual demonstrates longevity with the firm and participated in the example projects submitted in SF 330 Section F.  Use a separate Section E for each key personnel.  Do not generalize professional registrations or certifications, rather provide specific details. All architect/engineer disciplines must be registered in the appropriate professional field. For the purposes of this selection criteria, the use of the term &quot;registered&quot; is defined as a Registered Architect or Professional Engineer registered to practice in the particular discipline in a State, the District of Columbia, or an outlying area of the United States. The government will evaluate, as appropriate, the registration, education, certifications, overall and relevant project experience, and longevity with the firm. Provide Section G Key Personnel Participation In Example Projects. 

This criterion focuses on the qualifications of the key personnel for the contract and not the quantity of personnel, which is addressed under the &quot;capacity to accomplish the work&quot; criterion.

Provide key personnel resumes for the following:


	U.S. REGISTERED GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEER
	U.S. REGISTERED ENGINEERING GEOLOGIST

Key personnel resumes shall demonstrate their knowledge of locality.  Provide specific information on both the prime firm&rsquo;s / joint venture&rsquo;s (JV) and sub-consultants&rsquo; local experience and knowledge.  The prime firm&rsquo;s or JV&rsquo;s knowledge of locality will be evaluated more favorably than sub-consultants.  Example projects performed within the USACE POH AOR will have greater weight than those performed outside the USACE POH AOR.  The basis of evaluation for this criterion will focus on the information provided in SF330, Part I, Section E (Resume of Key Personnel), Section F (Example Projects), and H (Additional Information).

Although the firm&rsquo;s geographic proximity in relation to the location of the work will be considered, the firm&rsquo;s longevity and experience within the geographic proximity is of higher value. 

d. Past Performance:

The evaluation will consider all past performance of the prime A-E contractor as documented in the Government&#39;s Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) managed through the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS). Firms will be evaluated on past performance on schedule, cost, and management. Performance evaluations for the prime firm is considered the most relevant criteria; however, past performance for any significant subconsultants may also be considered. Performance evaluations on completed projects within seven (7) years of solicitation closing date and/or SF 330 Section F example projects is also considered more relevant.

Any credible, documented information on past performance may be submitted, but the government is not required to seek other information on past performance if none is available through PPIRS. An offeror may use Past Performance Questionnaires (PPQ) to provide or supplement a firm&#39;s past performance. Firms choosing to use the PPQ may obtain a PPQ standard form by submitting a request to POCs indicated in this solicitation.

SECONDARY selection criteria, to be used as &ldquo;tie-breakers&rdquo; among technically equal firms, are listed in descending order of importance as follows: 

f. Volume of recent DoD contract awards:  

Provide a complete listing of all work awarded to the Offeror within the previous twelve (12) months of this solicitation&rsquo;s closing date.  When identifying the total volume of work, include all stand-alone or indefinite delivery contract (IDC) task orders, including modifications, issued by DoD agencies.  For IDCs, include total value of task orders actually issued by agencies in the last 12 months.  DO NOT include the potential value of an IDC, nor options which have not been exercised.  For all types of contracts, do not include for consideration options that have not been exercised. Present information for this criterion in SF330, Part I, Section H (Additional Information).

4. BASIS FOR ADJECTIVAL EVALUATION:  An adjectival rating scale will be applied to each selection criteria with the highest possible rating first and in descending order: Excellent, Highly Acceptable, Acceptable, Marginal, Unacceptable.

Excellent (E): The proposal is outstanding in that it clearly demonstrates a thorough understanding of the requirements and greatly exceeds the minimum level for the criterion. The Offeror&rsquo;s capabilities are of the highest proficiency and are thoroughly illustrated or substantiated. The proposal is internally consistent throughout when addressing the criterion. The proposal has significant strengths in exceeding the minimum level of the criterion and contains no weaknesses or deficiencies.

Highly Acceptable (HA): The proposal is very good, demonstrates good understanding of requirements, and exceeds the minimum level for the criterion. The Offeror&rsquo;s capabilities are of high proficiency and are well justified or substantiated. The proposal contains very minor or no inconsistencies with other portions of the proposal when addressing the criterion. The proposal has strengths in exceeding the minimum level for the criterion and is not significantly offset by weaknesses and contains no deficiencies. 

Acceptable (A): The proposal is acceptable in that it meets the minimum level for the criterion. The proposal demonstrates an acceptable level of understanding of requirements. The Offeror&rsquo;s capabilities are of an acceptable level of competency and are sufficiently illustrated or substantiated. The proposal contains minor or no inconsistencies or incompatibilities with other portions of the proposal when addressing the criterion. The proposal has strengths in meeting the minimum level for the criterion and is not significantly offset by weaknesses and/or deficiencies.

Marginal (M): The proposal does not meet the minimum level for the criterion and does not demonstrate an acceptable level of understanding the requirements. The proposal is weak in providing sufficient evidence to demonstrate or illustrate its qualifications or capabilities to perform the anticipated work at an acceptable level of quality. The proposal contains inconsistencies in addressing the criterion. The proposal may have strengths in meeting a portion of the criterion; however, it is offset by weaknesses and/or deficiencies.

Unacceptable (U): The proposal is incomplete in that it does not satisfactorily meet the minimum level for this criterion. There is little to no evidence to illustrate that the firm understands the government&rsquo;s minimum requirements. The proposal lacks evidence to demonstrate or illustrate its capabilities to perform the anticipated work. The proposal may have strengths in meeting a portion of the criterion; however, it is completely offset by various inconsistencies, weaknesses, and deficiencies.

Only applies to Past Performance Acceptable (A):  The Offeror lacks past performance information in the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). The intent of this rating is not to penalize the Offeror for no past performance as a Prime A-E firm. Therefore, the Government will deem the Offeror to have an &ldquo;Unknown&rdquo; past performance. In the context of acceptability / unacceptability for past performance, &ldquo;Unknown&rdquo; shall be considered &ldquo;Acceptable.&rdquo;

            4.         DLA provides no funding for any offer submitted to this CSO.  DLA funding is only possible after a signed contract.



B.         Background:  DLA is the Department of Defense&rsquo;s logistics combat support activity.  DLA provides worldwide logistical support to the military services and other authorized customers, which may include civilian organizations and foreign countries.  Potential offerors may learn more about DLA at htts://www.dla.mil. 
 

C.         How to Submit a Solution Brief.




	Prior to the closing date of the published Area of Interest, electronically submit to the person identified in paragraph A.3. of this CSO an unclassified Solution Brief, utilizing the Solution Brief template at Attachment 1.
	 
	Mark as appropriate all parts of the Solution Brief considered proprietary.  By submitting a Solution Brief, the offeror agrees to DFARS 252.227-7016, Rights in Bid or Proposal Information.
	 
	The Solution Brief must &lsquo;stand alone&rsquo;.  While the Solution Brief may include references to outside materials, links to website, etc., DLA WILL NOT AND CAN NOT consider such material.  Similarly, DLA will not consider any accompanying slides, sales materials, integrated or outside videos, or the like sent with the Solution Brief.  DLA may reject, without further consideration, Solution Briefs sent with extraneous materials.





	Offerors may submit multiple Solution Briefs for each AOI.  While each Solution Brief may reference another Solution Brief, DLA WILL NOT AND CAN NOT consider that referenced Solution Brief in evaluating this submitted Solution Brief.   





	Solution Briefs&rsquo; prices and all other terms and conditions must remain valid for 180 calendar days from the submission date of the Solution Brief.




D.         How DLA Will Make Any Awards.



            1.         DLA will first review Solution Briefs for conformance with this CSO.  DLA will return Solution Briefs DLA finds not in conformance with this CSO.  The offeror may, if the date and time stated in the Area of Interest has not passed, re-submit a revised Solution Brief.  While DLA intends to complete this review diligently, DLA is under no obligation to complete this review soon enough for an offeror to submit a revised Solution Brief.  Therefore, offerors should submit their best, conforming, Solution Briefs.



            2.         For Solution Briefs both received before the closing time of CSO and AOI, and also conforming to the CSO, DLA subject-matter expert technical evaluators will evaluate the Solution Brief.  First, evaluators will evaluate Factor 1, Possibility of Funding, and rate the Solution Brief as either &ldquo;Funding Possible&rdquo; or &ldquo;Funding Not Possible&rdquo;.  If evaluated as &ldquo;Funding Not Possible,&rdquo; evaluators will not evaluate the Solution Brief further and DLA will notify the offeror.  If evaluated as &ldquo;Funding Possible,&rdquo; evaluators will continue their evaluations through the remaining factors, assigning each remaining factor one of the following ratings: &ldquo;Exceptional,&rdquo; &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; &ldquo;Acceptable,&rdquo; &ldquo;Marginal,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Unacceptable.&rdquo;  All evaluation factors are described below.



            a.   Factor 1: Possibility of Funding.  Does funding reasonably exist to fund the proposed solution?  Solutions with lower prices are favored.   



                        b.         Factor 2: Technical Feasibility.  How technically feasible is the proposed solution to an AOI, given the present state of the technology and science?  Solutions with a lower technological risk profile are favored. 



            c.   Factor 3: Responsiveness.  How responsive is the proposed solution to the AOI?  Solutions responsive to the problem identified in the AOI, without creating new problems, are favored.



            d.   Factor 4: Viability.  How viable is the proposed solution given existing organizational and regulatory environments?  Solutions compatible with existing DLA, DoD, and federal policies, processes, and procedures, are favored.



            e.   Factor 5: Desirability.  How desirable is the proposed solution to the eventual end-user?  Solutions easily adaptable, useful, and implementable are favored. 



      3.   After the above evaluation, the technical evaluators will then decide whether the solution proposed in the Solution Brief merits further consideration.  Note that while Solution Briefs are not evaluated against other Solution Briefs, DLA has limited funding and acquisition manpower and thus cannot pursue all otherwise meritorious Solution Briefs.  DLA also recognizes that industry resources in pursing business with DLA are limited.  To the extent DLA must select between highly rated Solution Briefs to pursue further, DLA will aggregate the Factor 2 through 5 ratings together equally to discern the most highly rated Solution Briefs.  If further discernment is necessary amongst highly rated Solution Briefs, DLA will then additionally consider the Factor 2 through 5 ratings in order of importance, with Factor 2 being the most important, Factor 3 being the second most important, Factor 4 being the third most important, and Factor 5 being the fourth most important.  And if still additional discernment is necessary, DLA will then consider the price proposed in the Solution Brief and select for further consideration the lowest priced Solution Brief.



      4.   If the technical evaluators decide a proposed Solution Brief merits further consideration, technical evaluators will decide whether to further consider the proposed solution via a Pitch, Full Proposal, or both.  Technical evaluators may also decide a Pitch or Full Proposal, or both, are unnecessary, and refer a Solution Brief for negotiation of a possible award as described in paragraph 5. 



            a.   Pitch: DLA would invite the offeror to &lsquo;pitch&rsquo; the offeror&rsquo;s proposed solution in a presentation, whether via a remote meeting, a face-to-face meeting, or other mutually agreeable means.  DLA will advise the offeror of the parameters of the Pitch at that time.  Offerors may propose different parameters; however, the final decision rests with DLA, as represented by the person noted in paragraph A(3).  During the Pitch, the parties may verbally discuss the proposed solution.  After the Pitch, DLA will decide whether an additional Pitch is desired, to request a full proposal, refer the offeror to the supporting contracting activity for award negotiations, or to terminate further consideration of the offer.   



            b.   Full Proposal: DLA would invite the offeror to submit a full proposal.  DLA will advise the offeror of the parameters of the full proposal at that time.  Offerors may propose different parameters; however, the final decision rests with DLA.  After receipt of the Full Proposal, DLA may communicate with the offeror about the Full Proposal, to better understand and review it.  After reviewing the Full Proposal, DLA will decide whether an additional or revised Full Proposal is desired, to request a &lsquo;Pitch&rsquo;, refer the offeror to the supporting contracting activity for award negotiations, or to terminate further consideration of the offer.    



      5.   If the technical evaluators refer an offeror to the supporting contracting activity for award negotiations, the supporting contracting activity will open negotiations with the offeror.  The conduct of such negotiations are within the discretion of the cognizant Contracting Officer or Agreement Officer, as the case may be, as bounded by applicable law and policy.  Offerors should note that the Contracting Officer, or Agreement Officer, is not required to award any contract and may close negotiations at any time at his or her discretion.  Offerors should further note that should any in negotiation resulting in an award, the prices awarded must be &lsquo;fair and reasonable&rsquo;. 



E.         Generally Applicable Information.



            1.         DLA provides no funds for partaking in any process described in this CSO.  Any funds will be disbursed only in accordance with a signed contract or other transaction agreement.



            2.         Should DLA award an other transaction agreement awarded under this CSO, DLA may later award a follow-on production contract or other transaction agreement without further competition, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. &sect; 4022. 



            3.         Note that Chapter 21 of Title 41, United States Code, applies to all submitted proposals and any awarded contract, whether awarded under the FAR or 10 U.S.C. &sect; 4022.



            4.         Note that DLA can only award to a responsible entity.  Please see FAR Part 9 for further information.

5109e9bc77f54af4abbcd10fdc165219,W912WJ25X14TW,"Mid-plume groundwater remediation at the Walton & Lonsbury Superfund Site, Attleboro, Massachusetts","The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing this Sources Sought Announcement to determine interest, availability, and capability of 8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Woman-Owned, and Small Business concerns to perform the work described below under a Best Value Fixed Price Remedial Action Contract (RAC). The NAICS code for this procurement is 562910 (size standard &lt;1,000 employees). Remediation field work is expected to be performed in 2026, and two rounds of performance monitoring would be completed in 2027. The value of the project is expected to be in the $5M to $10M range.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District desires to identify contractors capable of providing Environmental Remediation Services for the installation of a permeable reactive barrier (PRB), or treatment line, using zero-valent iron (ZVI) to reduce hexavalent chromium (Cr[VI]) to less toxic trivalent chromium in groundwater in the mid-plume area of the site southeast of the Walton &amp; Lonsbury (W&amp;L) property. This work is part of ongoing remediation activities in accordance with the Record of Decision (ROD)(EPA, 2019).

Responses to this Sources Sought announcement will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. After reviewing responses to this announcement, and if the Government still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in the https://sam.gov/ website for the respective project. NO SOLICITATION IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. All interested offerors will have the opportunity to respond to the solicitation announcement later.

Project Information:



The W&amp;L Superfund Site is a former electroplating facility that operated from 1940 to 2007. Since 2010, several environmental investigation and remediation activities have been performed at the site, including removal of W&amp;L facility buildings and residual waste materials, excavation and disposal of contaminated site media, and installation of an engineered cover behind residences along Paulette Lane and North Avenue to prevent upwelling of chromium-contaminated groundwater to the ground surface and to prevent direct exposure to chromium-contaminated soil. A PRB was constructed on the downgradient edge of the cover, with the goal of using zerovalent iron (ZVI) to reduce hexavalent chromium (Cr[VI]) to the less toxic trivalent chromium in groundwater before it discharges into Bliss Brook southeast of the W&amp;L property.



The selected remedy for the mid-plume of this project involves installing a minimum 2.5-foot-wide treatment line located along the west side of North Avenue, spanning 209 feet from approximately 80 ft south of PDI-MID-03S to approximately 25 ft north of PDI-MID-04D (see provided site plan) to depths ranging from approximately 25 to 35 feet below ground surface, keyed into the underlying till. The reactive medium is a 63% ZVI/37% sand mixture by weight on average. Bench and Pilot Tests performed by HGL environmental consultants have ruled out injection delivery methods. The USACE is open to other construction means and methods, but consideration must be given to the physical constraints at the site, including a limited working area between a busy road, overhead utility lines, and a wetland (see provided site plan). Management of contaminated saturated soil may be required. A temporary access road would need to be constructed across an existing wetland to facilitate construction of the treatment line. Note that minimizing the road footprint may allow the possibility of leaving the road after treatment line construction if flood storage compensation is maintained and wetland impacts can be mitigated through value enhancements and/or replication elsewhere.

98da46738fc44ef39623d95dce91135f,FA8684-QAMVAP,Request for Information on Qualification of Additive Manufacturing Vendors for Airworthiness Parts,"Please see the attachment for the full RFI. 

1. The DAF&rsquo;s desire to utilize additive manufacturing (AM) for flight-critical components necessitates the rigorous qualification of vendors. The US Air Force requests white papers that provide processes and procedures to qualify Additive Manufacturing (AM) vendors for parts with airworthiness considerations. The responses should outline a vetted process to assess and qualify AM vendors for airworthy parts by reviewing their quality management systems (QMS), material quality, process controls, design capabilities, data management, data and equipment security, and adherence to relevant regulations, such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Amazon Web Service (AWS), Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) and National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity requirements, Automated Material System (AMS) or American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards, specifications and practices. Ensuring that vendors meet these criteria is crucial for maintaining safety and performance in aviation. The purpose of this call for white papers is to develop a procedure that the USAF can follow to develop a qualified AM vendor list for parts with air worthiness considerations.


2. Problem Statement
The Air Force requires a standardized approach to qualify vendors for producing flight-critical components through additive manufacturing. This document invites vendors to provide procedures and recommendations for building a qualified provider list, including criteria for conducting audits and assessing compliance with airworthiness considerations.

3. This Request for Information (RFI) is for source planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, requests for quotation, request for proposal, abstracts, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Your response to this RFI will be treated as informational only. No entitlement to pay, direct or indirect costs, or charges to the Government will arise, as a result of a contractor&#39;s submission of a response(s) to this announcement or the Government&#39;s use of such information. This request does not constitute a solicitation for future proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. The information provided may be used by the Government in developing its source acquisition strategy and Statement of Work/Statement of Objectives and performance specifications. The Government does not intend to award a contract solely on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI. The purpose of this RFI is to gather information that will assist the Advanced Manufacturing Program Office (AMPO) in evaluating vendor capability of meeting its potential need. The Government has not determined the final acquisition approach. This market research will allow the AMPO to make an informed decision about how to proceed.

The Postal Service bases contract award decisions on best value.  The USPS is concerned with making an award to the supplier striking the appropriate balance of technical features and price. The USPS will not, however, make award to a higher priced offer which provides only marginal additional technical value. As technical scores become closer, then price becomes more important as to selection. However, the USPS may not necessarily make an award at the lowest price in order to achieve a small price savings if better value can be achieved with superior technical features.

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS:

The Technical Evaluation Plan will be assessed and scored on a scale of 100 points.  Solicitation Attachment 11 contains the scoring breakdown.

Upon entry of their information, visiting personnel will be provided an electronic form to download, which will have an individualized barcode and alpha numeric code. The codes should be submitted to the Project Manager/sponsor. Once in receipt of the barcode, the sponsor will email Security and Emergency Services and provide the bar
code and sponsorship information. Once the visitor/contractor is vetted and approved for installation access, Security &amp; Emergency Services will notify the sponsor that the visitor/contractor can go to the DSCR Visitor Center to obtain his/her pass. At the Visitor Center, the visitor provides the barcode and code provided earlier in the process and completes the credentialing process.

Background 

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)/ Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC) is hereby requesting information from potential sources for the Simulation and Advanced Software Services II (SASS II) solicitation. JSC is issuing this sources sought synopsis as a means of conducting market research to identify parties having an interest in and the resources to support this requirement, seeking capability statement, and requesting information from industry regarding potential organizational conflicts of interest (OCI) arising from this requirement. This acquisition will be a follow-on procurement to the current NASA Simulation and Advanced Software Service (SASS), Contract #80JSC020D0060. The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services. Under this NAICS code, a business is considered small if its average annual receipts are less than $34 million. 

The NASA/JSC is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including all socioeconomic categories of Small Businesses and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI), and members of the underserved communities as defined by Executive Order 13985, Advancing Racial Equity And Support For Underserved Communities Through The Federal Government, for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for SASS II. The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Women-owned (WOSB), Service-Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), Economically Disadvantaged Women-owned Small Business (EDWOSB) or HUBZone business set-aside based on responses received.

In addition to the information requested above, interested parties may also provide comments on this potential acquisition regarding proposed contract type, incentive arrangements, evaluation criteria, or performance metrics.  

The government will evaluate market information to ascertain potential market capacity to 1) provide services consistent in scope and scale with those described in this notice and otherwise anticipated; and 2) determine whether to conduct a competition with full and open competition or through a small business set-aside.  To assess the market capacity, the government will review potential offeror&rsquo;s past performance with respect to this type of work; and Experience providing services under a performance-based service acquisition contract. 

NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.  The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at: https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/Procurement-Ombuds-Comp-Advocate-Listing.pdf 

Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) 

In addition to the information requested above, NASA is requesting information from industry regarding potential OCI arising from the SASS II acquisition. 

The nature of the work anticipated under the SASS II may create the potential for OCI(s) as currently described in FAR Subpart 9.5.  Each interested party should review FAR Subpart 9.5 in light of NASA&rsquo;s anticipation of OCI issues and consider carefully the extent to which an OCI may arise before making the decision to compete for the SASS II.  

Specifically, NASA anticipates that the effort under the SASS II will include the following types of tasks which could lead to potential OCI issues.  This list is not all inclusive.  


	
	The Contractor may be required to provide technical support to NASA for new systems development for current and future programs/missions. (e.g. Orion, ISS, Gateway, etc.) 
	
	
	The Contractor may be required to inspect, evaluate, access, critique, review, or perform other similar services with respect to products or services provided by the Contractor under other NASA contracts. 
	
	
	This effort may require direct simulation and advance software service functions to the JSC Engineering, Flight Operations, and Human Health Performance Directorates and their contractor developed products. 
	


A link to the NASA&rsquo;s Guide on OCI is listed below: https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/regs/guides/OCI_Guide.pdf 

Please reference this document for additional information about NASA&rsquo;s policies with respect to OCI issues. Interested parties are requested to address the following questions: 

1. What type(s) of OCI issues would your company or potential team identify, if any, should you choose to propose on the SASS II contract?  

2. What strategies would you anticipate proposing to mitigate the OCI issues that you identified (if any)?  Please provide strategy details, previous examples/experience with other contracts with NASA or other agencies, etc. 

3. Are there any other types of potential OCI issues with the proposed SASS II contract that were not identified in this RFI (assuming any were identified)? 

4. Does your company foresee any OCI issues associated with the SASS II that would cause you to decide not to propose on the potential SASS II RFP? 

NASA will review any responses received regarding potential OCI and each offeror&rsquo;s proposed OCI mitigation strategy.  NASA will respond to each company who submits a mitigation strategy.  NASA&rsquo;s response is not intended to serve as a confirmation that, in fact, all potential OCI have been identified, an OCI will ultimately exist, or that an interested party is capable of successfully eliminating or mitigating an identified OCI.  NASA&rsquo;s response is also not intended to encourage or discourage any interested party from responding to an RFP issued for SASS II in the future.  Furthermore, NASA&rsquo;s response in no way alters or interprets FAR 9.5 as it applies to a final statement of work or a final proposal submission, should an interest party elect to submit a proposal to an RFP for SASS II.  Subsequent to the initial OCI submission and NASA&rsquo;s response, NASA will not consider further information as it relates to this RFI. 

Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility 

In support of the Executive Order (EO) 13985, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, NASA is seeking to advance equity or remove barriers for members of underserved communities related to this requirement. As defined in the EO, Underserved Communities refers to populations sharing a particular characteristic, as well as geographic communities, that have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic, social, and civic life, as exemplified by the list in the preceding definition of &quot;equity.&quot; Equity means the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. 

NASA seeks input in the following areas: 

1. To support the requirements identified in this request for information (RFI)/sources sought notification, what barriers or opportunities exist to engage subject matter experts from industry and academia and how can those barriers be overcome? How can underserved communities be leveraged? 

2. To support the requirements identified in this RFI, what barriers or opportunities exist to partner with subcontractors that employ members of underserved communities, as defined above? 

3. What other recommendations would you make to enhance diversity and inclusion? 

4. What should be considered to encourage full participation and contribution of organizations and individuals (e.g., outreach efforts and innovative partnerships) in performance of this requirement?

NAIHS-ACQ-09

UNAUTHORIZED COMMITMENTS 

SEP 2023




	Definitions.




Contracting Officer means a person with the authority to enter into, administer, and/or terminate contracts and make related determination and findings.



Ratification means the act of approving an unauthorized commitment by an official who has the authority to do so.



Unauthorized Commitment (UAC) means an agreement that is not binding solely because the Government representative who made it lacked the authority to enter into that agreement on behalf of the Government.




	Policy.




The Government is not bound by agreements with, or contractual commitments made to, prospective contractors by individuals who do not have delegated contracting authority. Unauthorized commitments do not follow the appropriate process for the expenditure of Government funds. Consequently, the Government may not be able to ratify certain actions, putting a contractor at risk for taking direction from a Federal official other than the contracting officer (see FAR 1.602-1) Government employees responsible for unauthorized commitments are subject to disciplinary action. Contractors perform at their own risk when accepting direction from unauthorized officials. Failure to follow statutory and regulatory processes for the expenditure of Government funds is a very serious matter.




	Procedure.




Any agreement, modification, or change to a contractual agreement made by a government personnel who lack authority will be deemed an unauthorized commitment.  The Government is not liable to the Contractor or under the terms of the contract, financially or otherwise &ndash; unless the unauthorized commitment successfully passes the ratification process.



The ratification process does not have any lead time, nor does the Government make any promise that an unauthorized commitment will be ratified and, therefore, the Contractor would be paid.  The Contractor proceeds at its own risk if any of the terms of the contract are altered, changed, or modified without the written concurrence by a Contracting Officer.

This Sources Sought requests industry feedback on direct experience with Architect-Engineer (A/E) services with a vertical design focus.  Required services may include full or abbreviated multi-disciplinary planning, design, and construction phase design services to support construction of new facilities, as well as facilities sustainment, restoration, modernization (FSRM), and demolition of existing vertical facilities, which may include other studies and services on Department of the Air Force (DAF) and Department of the Army (DA) installations in the United States and outlying territories.  This effort will support new and existing DoD criteria and the goals of Executive Order (E.O.) 14057.
 
The purpose of this undertaking by the United States (US) Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC), Air Force Installation Contracting Center (AFICC), United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and United States Army Installation Management Command (IMCOM) is to address mission resilience by making climate-informed design and construction decisions that will aid in the transition to Net-Zero facilities. 

This sources sought shall not be construed as a formal solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Information provided to the Government as a result of this posting is strictly voluntary and given with no expectation of compensation, and provided at no cost to the Government. The information obtained from the responses to this sources sought will aid the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition strategy, to include whether this requirement will be set aside for Small Business and/or any applicable socio-economic small business category. Accordingly, responses from Small Businesses are highly encouraged. A synopsis will be executed and posted separately at a future date and is estimated to occur in the SECOND HALF of FY24.

SMALL BUSINESS:  The Government will evaluate responses to this sources sought and determine if a Small Business (SB) set-aside or any of the targeted socio-economic programs (HUB Zone, 8(a) Small Business, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, or Women Owned Small Business), is appropriate for this MATOC. Therefore, AFICC/772 ESS is seeking input from Small Business firms to assist in establishing the most logical acquisition strategy.


FAR 52.219-14 Limitations of Subcontracting (DEVIATION 2021-O0008 Revision 1) applies to any resultant contract. If a portion or all of this contract synopsis/solicitation is set aside for Small Business, similarly-situated entities (i.e., other Small Businesses) can team with the SB Prime Offeror to ensure the 50% threshold is met. NOTE: Joint Venture (JV) entities are considered PRIME Contractors, and therefore any experience performed by the JV Firm or any of its JV entities are considered to be executed by the &ldquo;Prime&rdquo; &ndash; this arrangement is NOT considered a Prime-to-Sub Teaming partner arrangement. If the JV Prime entity itself is a SB, then all work to be executed by that JV entity will also count toward the 50% threshold required by FAR 52.219-14 DEVIATION 2021-O0008 Revision 1.

NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) is seeking partners interested in developing competitive proposals in response to NASA Announcements of Opportunity (AOs), Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs), Missions of Opportunity (MoOs) and proposal calls from other government agencies. ARC is interested in identifying potential partners that can perform science investigations, conduct research activities, and develop and demonstrate new technologies that are aligned with NASA&rsquo;s goals. Information is also sought regarding partners that, in addition to performing substantial research, can provide flight hardware (i.e., spacecraft, deployment systems, suborbital systems, ground support systems, equipment, or instrumentation) necessary to implement proposed science investigations, research activities or technology demonstration missions.

NASA often competitively selects scientific investigations, technology development and demonstration missions through solicitations or announcements posted on NSPIRES http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external. These missions are typically led by a single Principal Investigator (PI), Principal Technologist (PT), or Project Manager (PM). The PI, PT, or PM may be from Government or non-Government institutions, including academic institutions, industry, or nonprofit entities, one of NASA&rsquo;s nine field Centers, NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), other federally funded research and development centers, or other U.S. Government agencies. Mission teams may be formed from any combination of these institutions including international partners. ARC may respond to an AO or other proposal calls in either a lead or supporting role.

ARC has a history of responding to a wide variety of NASA AOs including:

Planetary Exploration AOs from the NASA New Frontiers Program (https://www.nasa.gov/planetarymissions/newfrontiers.html), the NASA Discovery Program (https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/programs/discovery), and the NASA SIMPLEx program (https://soma.larc.nasa.gov/simplex/); various AOs from the NASA Explorers Program (https://explorers.gsfc.nasa.gov) including MIDEX, SMEX, and Missions of Opportunity (MoO); and Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) calls. ARC anticipates responding to current and future AOs in these and other areas as well.

A full description of current, future, and past calls for proposals from SMD, STMD, ESDMD, SOMD, and ARMD at NASA Headquarters can be found at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external.

This synopsis/special notice is posted annually in anticipation of upcoming AOs and may have subsequent specific updates as ARC seeks partners for specific proposal opportunities. ARC is currently considering responding to AOs from NASA&#39;s Science Mission Directorate (SMD), Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD), Space Operations Mission Directorate (SOMD), and Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate (ESDMD).

Current NSPIRES AOs to which ARC may be interested in responding are listed below by NASA Mission Directorate. ARC is interested in responding to future NSPIRES AOs and AOs from other sources, such as NSF, NIH, and others within the next several years.

Responses from prospective partners are encouraged even if a particular solicitation is not on the list below. ARC typically begins many of its efforts in response to planned or anticipated future AOs 18 to 36 months in advance of the release of the draft AO.

Classification and General Information:

This requirement will be issued as a Full and Open Competition

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code associated with this procurement is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction. The Small Business Administration standard of $45 million dollars in annual receipts averaged over a business&rsquo;s latest three (3) complete fiscal years or (except in the Business Loan and Disaster Loan Programs) five (5) complete fiscal years to determine the average annual receipts. If a business hasn&rsquo;t been in business for five (5) years, multiply its average weekly revenue by 52 to determine its average annual receipts.

This contract will be Full and Open, and the contractor shall be selected by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.1 Source Selection procedures. This procurement will be competitive, utilizing the Tradeoff Process approach under the Best Value Continuum (FAR 15.101). This process permits tradeoffs among cost or price and technical factors. It allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced offeror or different than the highest technically rated offeror. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. The best value method is essential to evaluate and compare costs and prices to select the most advantageous offer. The planned project delivery method will result in a Firm- Fixed-Price contract for construction services.

Background Overview:

This Commercial Solutions Opening (CSO) solicitation is issued in accordance with DoD Class Deviation 2018-O0016 &ldquo;DoD Commercial Solutions Opening Pilot Program.&rdquo;

Federal Agency Name: Air Force Test Center

Federal Agencies Capable of Issuing Contracts/Agreements: The FAST CSO is targeted to the Air Force Test Center (AFTC) and other associated partners in test, including the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC). However, other organizations seeking innovative solutions to their test needs may issue Calls and subsequent awards/agreements under this CSO. Organizations outside of AFTC, AFRL, and AFOTEC can contact the Contracting Point of Contact (POC) identified within this document.

CSO Number: FA9302-21-S-C001

Commercial Solutions Opening (CSO) Type: This is an open CSO with Calls. Meaning this CSO will be &ldquo;amended&rdquo; to issue Calls as objectives requiring innovative solutions are identified by various organizations within the defense test community. These Calls will be issued by organizations, posted on betasam.gov in separate instances, and the Calls will reference the FAST CSO. The FAST CSO will remain open for the issuance of Calls until 30 Sep 22. All contract awards or agreements made against Calls under this CSO must be made on or before 30 Sep 22. The CSO general solicitation method is a pilot program. The intent is to extend FAST should the pilot program be extended or made permanent[1]. Contracts and agreements issued against this CSO are considered &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; notwithstanding the definition of Commercial Item in FAR 2.101. This document is not a request for white papers or proposals. Please note, interested parties will not be reimbursed for costs associated with responding to this CSO, to include responses to Calls issued against this CSO.

Calls: Calls will include areas of interest (AOI) defined by the organizations issuing the calls. Each call can be designed to meet the needs of the issuing organization. Descriptions of potential Call structures can be found below. Calls will include instructions to interested parties, due dates for white papers/proposal submissions, and selection criteria.

Call Structures:

One-Step: The one-step process is used to request full technical and cost proposals from each interested party. The proposals are evaluated in accordance with the solicitation criteria and all of a selected proposal, part of a selected proposal, or none of the proposals are selected.

Two-Step: The two-step process is sometimes used when a large number of proposals are anticipated. Potential interested parties are invited to submit brief descriptive white papers in lieu of full proposals. The Call must state whether an unfavorable white paper evaluation will bar the interested parties from further consideration. Full proposals are requested from those interested party selected in the white paper evaluation process. When proposals are received, they are evaluated, and selection decisions are made.

Open: This approach allows for White Paper and/or proposal submission at any time within a specified period or at any time during the Call&rsquo;s availability. A Call issued against the FAST CSO will be available for maximum of one year. With this approach, White Papers and/or proposals are evaluated as received.

Closed: This approach allows for white paper and/or proposal submittals at a specified date and time as set forth within the Call. Late bid and proposal provisions (IAW FAR 52.215-1(c)(3)) are usually included in the Call.  

White Paper/Proposal Submission: White Papers and/or proposals must be submitted to the Contracting Point of Contact (POC) identified within each Call.

Solicitation Request: White papers or Proposals are not requested at this time. White papers or proposals will be solicited via Calls.

Evaluations Factors: The primary evaluation factors for selecting proposals for award shall be technical, importance to agency programs, and funds availability. Price shall be considered to the extent appropriate, but at a minimum, to determine that the price is fair and reasonable. Calls may add to these factors (e.g., past performance).

Debriefings: Debriefings will be handled in accordance with FAR 52.212-1(l). The cognizant Contracting Officer for each Call will determine the best method to provide debriefings (i.e., phone call, in-person brief, or written).

North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code: NAICS codes will be identified within each Call issued against this CSO.

Type of Contract/Instrument: The government intends to award FAR Part 12, fixed price type contracts as a result of this solicitation; however, the government also reserves the right to award an Other Transaction for Prototype project pursuant to 10 USC 2371b. The government may also award follow-on production contracts related to Other Transaction for Prototype projects issued under this CSO. The government further reserves the right to award all, part, or none of the proposals received.

 Estimated Program Cost: There is no cumulative ceiling estimated for this CSO. However, individual awards are not anticipated to exceed $100M. Should an offeror desire to submit a solution in excess of this value, the offeror shall contact both the cognizant FAST CSO Contracting Officer and the Call Contracting Officer for the stated area of interest. Detailed estimated cost or funding profiles may be included in Calls and amendments for Open Periods.

Anticipated Number of Awards: It is anticipated that organizations will award multiple awards supporting efforts described within Calls. However, organizations issuing Calls reserve the right to award zero, one, or more contracts/agreements for all, some or none of the solicited effort based on the offeror&#39;s ability to perform desired work and funding limitations.

Brief Program Summary: The objective of the FAST CSO is to provide a mechanism by which the government can partner with industry. To do so, the government must broaden its horizons &ndash; in order to bring innovative solutions required to accelerate the efficiency and effectiveness of our nation&rsquo;s test mission. Awards and agreements will be issued to industry partners offering &ldquo;innovative solutions&rdquo; to the described objectives, desired end states, or capability gaps defined by organizations issuing Calls. To be considered, the solutions offered must meet the definition of an innovative solution. For the purposes of this CSO, innovative means any technology, process, or method including research and development, that is new as of the date of the proposal submission; or any new application of an existing technology, process, or method as of the proposal date. Additionally, this CSO may result in the award of research and development contracts/agreements ranging from basic research through operational systems development.

Communication Between Prospective Offerors and Government Representatives:

Open communication is encouraged. Questions, suggestions, or feedback related to the FAST CSO can be provided to the FAST CSO POC identified within this document.

Calls: Specific communications related to objectives within a Call, will be treated in accordance with instructions provided within that Call. Open communications are encouraged otherwise.

BRIEF PROGRAM SUMMARY:

This is a five (5) year Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) describing the research areas of interest for the Directed Energy Directorate. This BAA approach allows for proposal submittals at a specified date and time, which will be posted through the issuance of Calls at various times against this BAA. This BAA will be reviewed no less frequently than annually and updates will be published in the System for Award Management (SAM) (https://sam.gov). Any changes or cancellation of the BAA will be posted as amendments to this BAA. This annual review and subsequent amendment to the BAA shall meet the requirement of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 35.016 to publish the BAA no less frequently than annually. As technical requirements are identified, Calls may be issued in SAM.gov to request proposals for specific research efforts. These subsequent Calls will contain specific descriptions of the research effort to be addressed, anticipated period of performance, information peculiar to the specific research technical topic area, and the estimated funding profile for the Call.

PROPOSAL DUE DATE AND TIME: NO PROPOSALS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED AGAINST THIS OVERARCHING BAA. Proposal due dates and times will be specified in each Call announcement. Proposals received after the due date and time specified in the Call shall be governed by the provisions of the FAR 52.215-1(c)(3). It should be noted that this installation observes strict security procedures to enter the facility. These security procedures are NOT considered an interruption of normal Government processes, and proposals received after the due date and time specified in the Call because of security delays will be considered  late&rdquo;. 

Furthermore, note that if offerors utilize commercial carriers in the delivery of proposals, they may not honor time-of-day delivery guarantees on military installations. Early proposal submission is encouraged.

GENERAL INFORMATION: This acquisition is unrestricted. This BAA is issued under the provisions of FAR 6.102(d)(2) that provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. Proposals submitted in response to this BAA that are selected for award are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition In Contracting Act of 1984. Offerors MUST monitor SAM in the event this announcement is amended, and for the posting of Calls.

ANNOUNCEMENT MODIFICATIONS: Due to the dynamically evolving nature of US warfighter directed energy needs, this announcement is potentially subject to include updates, revisions, or additional topic areas. Therefore, Offerors are highly encouraged to continually monitor SAM to ensure they receive latest guidance to this announcement.

TYPE OF CONTRACTS/INSTRUMENTS: The Air Force reserves the right to award the instrument best suited to the nature of research proposed. Accordingly, the Government may award any appropriate contract type under the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

The Government anticipates that a mix of contract types will be used throughout the life of this BAA. Generally, awards under this announcement may be Cost-Plus-Fixed Fee (Completion and Term), Cost Contract, or Firm Fixed Price. There are no opportunities for Other Transactions, Grants, Cooperative Agreements, or other types of non-FAR instruments under this announcement.

Cost-type contracts will require successful Offerors to have an accounting system deemed adequate by Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) for tracking costs under a cost reimbursable contract (DFARS 242.75). If an Offeror does NOT have a DCAA approved accounting system, a cost-type contract cannot be awarded.

ANNUAL REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS: Potential offerors are notified that effective 01 Jan 2005 to be eligible for an award and in compliance with FAR 52.204-7 and DFARS 252.204-7007 Alternate A, they must submit Annual Representations and Certifications, via SAM.gov. Before submitting the electronic Annual Representations and Certifications, Contractors must be registered in the SAM Database. Online registration instructions can be accessed from the SAM at https://sam.gov. These FAR and DFAR level representations and certifications are required in addition to the representations and certifications that may be attached to each Call.

ESTIMATED PROGRAM COST: Anticipated funding for the program (not per Call, contract, or award):

FY24              FY25            FY26            FY27            FY28            TOTAL
$100M          $100M         $100M          $100M          $99M           $499M 

This funding profile is an estimate only and will not be a contractual obligation for funding. All funding is subject to change due to Government discretion and availability. All potential offerors should be aware that due to unanticipated budget fluctuations, funding in any or all areas may change with little or no notice.

ANTICIPATED NUMBER OF AWARDS: The Air Force anticipates awarding a minimum of one contract per specific Call. However, the Air Force reserves the right to make multiple awards or no awards pursuant to a Call. There is no limit on the number of contracts that may be awarded to an individual Offeror.

SYSTEM FOR AWARD MANAGEMENT (SAM) REGISTRATION: Before the Government can award a contract, an Offeror must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). It is in the Offeror&rsquo;s interest to visit SAM and ensure that all the Offeror&rsquo;s data is up to date from SAM and other databases to avoid delay in award. SAM allows firms interested in conducting business with the federal government to provide basic information on business capabilities and financial information. To register, visit https://www.sam.gov.

Amendment 06 &ndash; Revision to TACTICAL Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) Program Protection language and GFP Clause List (21 November 2024)

The purpose of this amendment is to revise the TACTICAL Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) Program Protection language included in Section I paragraph 9 (formerly included in Section I paragraph 8) of the TACTICAL full text announcement included in the attachments. The revised paragraph is as follows:

9) Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) Program Protection:  Offerors are notified that subsequent Call Announcements shall include a requirement for submission of the documents identified below. Offerors may be asked to provide a mitigation plan for any identified S&amp;T Protection risks.

The Government reserves the right to determine an Offeror unawardable on the grounds of unacceptable S&amp;T Protection risk based on its review of the SF 424 and Security Program Questionnaire. During the security review process, if it is determined that personnel listed to perform work are identified as potentially having a conflict of interest/commitment, the Government will not award the contract.

a) Security Risk Review. Each proposal submission will be subject to a Security Risk Review prior to selection for award. The Security Risk Review is applied to federally funded research designed to help protect Department of the Air Force Science and Technology (S&amp;T) by identifying possible vectors of undue foreign influence. AFRL will follow all policy and procedures outlined in Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Instruction AFRLI 61-113, Science and Technology Protection for the Air Force Research Laboratory and Department of the Air Force Instruction DAFI 63-101/20-101, Integrated Lifecycle Management.

b) Security risk review for these subject proposals will be developed for all proposed Senior/Key personnel and &ldquo;Covered Individuals&rdquo;. These risk reviews will be based on information disclosed in a Research and Related Senior and Key Person Profile and Security Questionnaire. In addition, any accompanying or referenced documents, publicly available information, and information contained in internal U.S. Government databases will be utilized in risk reviews. Nationality or citizenship is not a factor in the security risk reviews.

c) When considering all external engagements, AFRL incorporates a holistic decision-making process that encompasses technical and security factors. The security review method implemented by AFRL measures risk factors to identify the appropriate Risk Acceptance Level (RAL) within the organization. The objective analysis of the security risk factors is conducted to empower AFRL&rsquo;s S&amp;T leaders to make risk-informed decisions. The review process generally looks at five factors, or risk areas, but with authority for expanded review as noted in OSD R&amp;E Memorandum dated 6 Jun 2023 t. The potential security risk factors are set forth below:

Potential security risk factors:

(see TACTICAL BAA Announcement_20241112 update in Attachments for image)

Actions Required by Applicants at proposal or white paper submission:

a. In accordance with AFRLI 61-113, S&amp;T Protection, Applicants/Recipients are required to submit the following documentation with their proposal:

(i) Standard Form 424, &ldquo;Research and Related Senior and Key Person Profile (Expanded) AND

(ii) Security Program Questionnaire AND

(iii) &ldquo;Privacy Act Statement&rdquo; consent form for each Covered Individual that is also signed by the Applicant as that Individual&rsquo;s Sponsor.

In the event a security risk is identified, and the Government has determined the security risk exceeds the acceptable threshold, the Applicant/Recipient will be notified and informed of the termination/decline of award. The Government will only provide a general statement of the reasoning due to Government OPSEC measures.

By submission of the Research and Related Senior Key Person Profile and Security Program Questionnaire, the Applicant agrees to comply with the following:

a. To certify that each covered individual who is listed on the application has been made aware: (1) of all relevant disclosure requirements, including the requirements of 42 U.S.C. &sect; 6605; and (2) that false representations may be subject to prosecution and liability pursuant to, but not limited to, 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;287, 1001, 1031 and 31 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 3729-3733 and 3802. See National Science and Technology Council Guidance for Implementing National Security Presidential Memorandum 33 (NSPM-33) on National Security Strategy for United States Government-Supported Research and Development (January 2022).

b. To establish and maintain an internal process or procedure to address foreign talent programs, conflicts of commitment, conflicts of interest, and research integrity.

c. To exercise due diligence to identify Foreign Components or participation by Senior/Key Personnel in Foreign Government Talent Recruitment Programs and agree to share such information with the Government upon request.

ARA Title: Directed Energy Technology Experimentation Research Announcement (DETER)

ARA Type: This is an Open ARA with Calls; initial announcement

ARA Number: FA9451-21-S-0001

Program Summary:
This is an Open ARA announcement pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. &sect;4023 (formerly 10 U.S.C. &sect;2373).  AFRL/RD is interested in receiving white papers and proposals through a Two-Step Process to perform research and development (R&amp;D), modeling and simulation (M&amp;S), design, component/subsystem, prototype risk reduction, fabrication/purchase, assembly, integration, and testing of directed energy source components (to include spares and alternate component technologies), and/or systems and any required accessories, materials, and supplies for laboratory research and experimentation and field trials in a relevant environment to demonstrate system capabilities.  Dialogue between prospective Offerors and Government representatives is strongly encouraged. *Note: AFRL/RD reserves the right to collapse a white paper/Two-Step into a One-Step if the situation warrants the white paper contains sufficient technical detail to do full technical proposal evaluation instead of white paper evaluation.

*Please see the attached DETER Industry User Guide for guidance on definitions, processes, submission requirements and evaluation criteria.*

Background:  AFRL/RD equips the joint warfighter with next-generation technologies, advanced concepts, and weapon system options across all operational domains to become more agile and increase the commercialization potential of directed energy investments to ensure the National defense.  

This solicitation intends to use acquisition authorities provided by 10 U.S.C. &sect;4023 (formerly 10 U.S.C. &sect;2373). This authority applies to acquisition of items related to &ldquo;&hellip;ordnance, signal, chemical activity, transportation, energy, medical, space-flight, and aeronautical supplies, including parts and accessories, and designs thereof, that are necessary for experimental or test purposes in the development of the best supplies that are needed for the national defense.&rdquo;  Consequently, white papers and proposals should address how the proposed effort provides benefits to the national defense and a strategy for verifying those intended benefits.

The proposed solutions should be innovative and substantially improve national defense capabilities across the domains of directed energy.  While the Government describes discrete topic areas below, it also anticipates that certain comprehensive technology solutions and prototypes may require multidiscipline approaches that address two or more topic areas.  The topic areas are covered under this announcement, which may be used in any combination.  The Government reserves the right to add, delete or modify the topic areas as necessary.  

Communication between Prospective Offerors and Government Representatives: Dialogue between prospective Offerors and Government representatives is strongly encouraged throughout the life of this ARA.  However, communication will be limited once full-proposals are submitted for evaluation/review. Prospective Offerors are welcome to request sit-downs and provide demonstrations of their capabilities. Discussions shall not constitute a commitment by the Government to subsequently fund or award any proposed effort.  No guidance related to technical approach will be given. However, questions related to the objectives of the effort or prior similar efforts may be answered.  Offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to contractually bind or otherwise commit the Government.  


THIS WILL BE A HYBRID ANNOUNCEMENT:  This announcement has an open request for white papers as described below.  Calls may be issued under this announcement for discrete requirements.  Call types can vary and may include, but are not limited to, One-Step, Two-Step, Open, Closed, Staggered, Limited Calls or any combination therein.  AFRL/RD reserves the right to collapse a white paper/Two-Step into a One-Step if the situation warrants the white paper contains sufficient technical detail to do full technical proposal evaluation instead of white paper evaluation.  

Open Announcement Request: AFRL/RD Kirtland Air Force Base is soliciting white papers on the research effort described in the below topic areas pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. &sect;4023 (formerly 10 U.S.C. &sect;2373), Procurement for Experimental Purposes.

Open Announcement Submission: White papers must be submitted to https://usg.valideval.com/teams/DETER/signup. If it is determined that a classified white paper is required, please DO NOT DELIVER any classified portion of the white paper, but rather contact the DETER Org Mailbox for specific delivery instructions.  Further instructions for white paper submission can be found in the DETER Industry User Guide attached to this announcement.

Call Request: Calls, other than Limited Calls, will be issued under this announcement via the Government Point of Entry (GPE) at https://beta.sam.gov.  Notification of Calls may be announced on other platforms (i.e. www.grants.gov) and will direct Offerors to the GPE for full solicitation details.

Call Submission: Submission requirements for Calls will be specified in the solicitation documentation of each Call.

Call Variations: Variations of the ARA Call process are available for use. The following types are commonly used, but are not considered all inclusive.  

One-Step: The one-step process is used to request full technical and cost proposals from each Offeror. The proposals are reviewed in accordance with the solicitation criteria and typically all of a selected proposal, part of a selected proposal, or none of the proposals may be selected for award.

Two-Step: The two-step process is sometimes used when a large number of proposals are anticipated. Potential Offerors are invited to submit brief descriptive white papers in lieu of full proposals. The Call must state whether an unfavorable white paper review will bar the Offeror from further consideration.  The Government may retain unselected white papers for a specific period of time, which will be identified in the solicitation. Full proposals are requested from those Offerors selected in the white paper review process. After proposals are received, they are reviewed consistent with the process for one-step ARAs.

Open Call: This approach allows for white paper and/or proposal submittals at any time within a specified period. Open calls will be updated no less frequently than annually. White papers/proposals are reviewed when received during the period that the ARA is open.

Closed Call: This approach allows for white paper and/or proposal submittals at a specified date and time as set forth in the ARA. 

Staggered-Closed Call: The staggered-closed Call states a specified date and time for receipt of proposals or white papers, but also allows for proposals/white papers after the date and time set for proposal receipt. All Offerors should be cautioned, however, that the likelihood of funding proposals received after the specified date and time is substantially reduced.

Limited Call: This approach allows for solicitation to a limited group of potential offerors.  Request for Proposals (RFP) or Requests for white papers will be issued directly to potential offerors without a requirement to publish to the GPE.

The Government may issue solicitations that combine one or more of the above approaches.

Open Announcement Modifications: Due to the dynamically evolving nature of US warfighter directed energy needs, this announcement is subject to updates, revisions, or additional topic areas. Therefore, Offerors are highly encouraged to continually monitor https://beta.sam.gov to ensure they receive the latest guidance for this announcement.  The Government shall provide updates to this announcement no less than annually.  Updates may include changes to: topic areas, submission requirements, administrative changes, evaluation criteria, solicitation methods, etc. (not an inclusive list).

Type of Contract/Instrument: The Air Force reserves the right to award the instrument best suited to the nature of the research proposed. Accordingly, the Government may award any appropriate contract/instrument type under the authorities below:

Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 
10 U.S.C. &sect;4021 (formerly 10 U.S.C. &sect;2371) &quot;Other Transaction for Research

32632d542d9948e69b9d5be69907abd8,36C24525Q0148,U008--Amputee Coalition Contract,"B.2  STATEMENT OF WORK


	Title of Project: VHA Amputation System of Care (ASoC) Amputation Peer Support Program
	Scope of Work:  The contractor shall provide all manpower, resources and materials necessary to expand the ASoC Peer Program tailored to the needs of the specialized population within the VA. This includes a Train-the-Trainer program for Amputation Rehabilitation Coordinators (ARCs) and other Amputation Specialty clinicians within the Amputation System of Care that will occur annually at sites determined by the presence of at least eight (8) potential Veteran Certified Peer Visitor candidates. The Train-the-Trainer program is a hands-on, in-person training with a goal of meeting the needs of Veterans with limb loss through a peer support program. Trainer candidates will experience a training focused on teaching the adult learner, the characteristics of adult learning, effective training techniques, facilitation tips, and role playing for assessment to ensure learning transfer. Candidates will train an in-person class on the final day of the training as an assessment of their newly learned skills. Once completed, the trainees will be certified trainers who will train and certify Veteran amputee peer mentors. The instructor of this program shall be a Certified Master Trainer through the Association for Talent Developer (ATD).

In effort to support the needs of both the healthcare provider and patients, it is necessary to have educational resources to provide information on living life with limb loss. Research promotes peer to peer support in the recovery after amputation as well as encouragement in returning to the highest level of function. Peer to peer support is a key recommendation in the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline, 2017. It is of utmost importance to Veterans that the VA provide this service as part of the overall rehabilitation process. Access to educational materials, training and a peer-to-peer programs will enhance VA care ensuring the highest quality amputation care.

		Identify core features or capabilities that are shared across all options, such as log aggregation, visualization tools, and monitoring capabilities, regardless of the license type.
	
	
	For each licensing option/solution set, clarify how it meets the above requirements for our logging and monitoring needs.
	
		Please highlight specific ways in which each licensing tier can address our operational, security, and compliance needs, particularly in areas like multi-environment visibility, role-based access control, and support for compliance auditing.
	
	






Pricing Information:


	For each license, please provide estimated transition and training costs and schedule for both transitioning to and from your proposed solution.
	
		Include details on onboarding costs, consulting, or configuration support required for a smooth transition. Specify any training options available, such as workshops, online courses, or documentation resources, and their associated costs.
	
	
	For each license, please provide any price plans associated such as monthly, trial, annual. 
	
		Indicate if discounts are offered for longer-term contracts or high-volume deployments. For cloud-managed options, provide cost breakdowns for storage, query processing, and other usage-based charges.
	
	




Other Considerations: 


	Are there any additional features or benefits associated with the different licenses that we should consider? 
	
		For example, are advanced analytics, machine learning-based anomaly detection, or pre-built integrations with other monitoring tools included at higher licensing tiers? Please clarify any value-added services, such as dedicated account support, proactive health checks, or best-practice workshops, that come with certain licenses.
	
	
	Is your company willing to enter into contracts with a base year with up to four one-year options? If not, how many years is your company willing to agree to?
	
		For longer-term contracts, specify any guarantees on pricing, renewal terms, or opportunities to adjust the contract scope to accommodate potential changes in our data volume or monitoring requirements.
	
	




We are eager to find a solution that will best support our needs and ensure continued productivity.

Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) is soliciting pre-proposals and full proposals for applied Biomedical Research and Diving Equipment Development with a focus on Diver Health, Safety, and Performance, Deep Diving Advancements, and Submarine Escape and Rescue.  The program&rsquo;s goals are presented in detail below.  It is the intent that this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) be open for a two-year period from the date of publication.  Specified dates are given in paragraph 2.a. below for submission of pre-proposals and full proposals to be awarded within Fiscal Year (FY) 2026 and 2027.



1.  Primary Areas of Interests



Program objectives are to focus research on improving or developing diving equipment for rapid transition to fleet capabilities, and biomedical aspects of Diver Health, Safety, and Performance, Deep Diving, and Submarine Escape and Rescue to develop and/or improve procedures that increase Navy personnel safety and effectiveness.  The typical project will be two years or less, although three-year projects will be considered. Contracts awarded as a result of these BAAs historically average around $300K or less cost annually. This information is provided for informational purposes only to provide a sense of scope desired by NAVSEA. This is not an obligatory value and pre-proposals/proposals valued above or below will be considered. However, budgetary constraints are a deciding factor in the selection for award.



      a. Diving:  This interest area is comprised of five task areas focused on items that impose limitations on diver capabilities, specifically: breathing gas supply; human performance; protection from the undersea environment; decompression; and tools, transportation and training.  Focus areas for each task are:




	Breathing Gas Supply (product goal should meet both US Navy General Specification for Diving and Manned Hyperbaric Systems and US Navy Dive Manual requirements):
	
		Improve carbon dioxide (CO2) scrubbing materials or systems (i.e. canister systems), used for both free-swimming (i.e. underwater breathing apparatuses (UBAs)) and fixed systems (i.e. recompression chambers), that extend diving duration;
		Develop portable, minimal power input, ambient oxygen (O2) concentrators capable of working in conjunction with existing diving air compressors;
		Improve helium reclaim systems to support mixed gas and saturation diving systems and compact, portable mix-making system to reduce large gas storage logistical footprints;
		Develop CO2 sensor and improve O2 sensors for measuring ppO2 in closed-circuit UBA;
		Develop innovative diluent gas solutions that combine the advantages of nitrogen&rsquo;s abundance and availability and helium&rsquo;s non-narcotic properties;
		Develop high-pressure air flasks, hoses and regulators, with high pressure defined for this purpose as greater than 5,000 pounds per square inch (psi), for surface-supplied diving (SSD) emergency gas supplies (EGS) and SCUBA/ closed and semi-closed UBAs. Current diver worn EGS is not sufficient to provide organic gas supply for recovery from deepest depths if primary gas source is lost.
	
	





	Human Performance:
	
		Improve understanding of oxygen toxicity mechanisms and oxygen toxicity mitigation development;
		Develop pharmacological or other novel mitigations to prevent or delay pulmonary and CNS oxygen toxicity;
		Develop and/or refine underwater noise protection strategies, equipment, and diver underwater exposure limits;
		
			Improve current comprehension of the environmental and physiological mechanisms via which sound is perceived via wetted auditory interface;
			Develop permissible exposure limits (PEL) for typical broadband noise sources insonifying the aquatic mission environment;
			Develop compact, adaptive, wearable acoustic dosimetry technology for use in conjunction with PEL and to inform long-term auditory hazards associated with diving; 
			Develop methods to assess and mitigate diver underwater sound/blast/implosion exposure.
		
		
		Refine the understanding of hypercapnia and its effects on divers and mitigations thereof;
		Improve understanding of gas (N2, O2, CO2) narcosis to include mitigations and predictions of equivalent narcotic depths;
		Improve understanding of effects on the human body from immersion, exertion, breathing resistance, and temperature, or a combination thereof, in relation to working underwater;
		Develop breathing standards for resting and working personnel in dry hyperbaric environments to 6 Atmospheres Absolute (ATA).
	
	


(3)  Protection from the Environment:   


	Improve knowledge of submerged body heat loss/retention to inform development of future heating/cooling systems; Develop analytical tools for exposure planning for deep / long duration diving operations based off know levels of thermal protection and environmental factors (i.e. depth, temperature, etc.);
	Improve heating/cooling methods/systems for submerged free-swimming divers; Examine novel mechanism for actively cooling a diver underwater. Specifically in helmeted or unhelmeted and tethered and untethered conditions. The system should be capable of functioning in a highly contaminated environment;
	Improve physical protection for divers in contaminated water (i.e. full encapsulation) to include novel non-permeable membranes;
	Improve equipment and procedures used to decontaminate divers and diving gear;
	Improve equipment and/or procedures to detect and quantify biologic and/or chemical contamination on-site within 24 hours of diving;
	Develop permissible exposure limits for common biological/chemical contaminants for risk mitigation planning.


(4)  Decompression:  


	Develop/test decompression models valid across the full spectrum of U.S. Navy diving, including diving to depths beyond 300 fsw;
	Develop pharmacological or other novel mitigations for preventing or treating decompression sickness;
	Improve decompression sickness diagnosis through, but not limited to, the utilization of algorithms;
	Improve decompression guidance using alternate gas mixtures.


(5)  Tools, Transportation and Training:


	Improve diver communications, both wired and through-water;
	Improve the ability to track diver location underwater from surface support craft;
	Improve through-water data communication for divers (text, navigation, biometrics);
	Improve diver propulsion devices to include diver worn and diver as passenger.




      b.   Submarine Escape and Rescue:  This interest area relates to optimizing submariner survival in a disabled submarine event.  Focus areas are:  


	Development of rapid, accurate methods to assess a disabled submarine (DISSUB) atmosphere, with focus on Submarine Escape Action Limit (SEAL) gases, to internal pressures up to 6 ATA;
	Develop novel means to mitigate oxygen toxicity (Pulmonary and CNS) aboard a pressurized disabled submarine;
	Develop novel means to accelerate or eliminate saturation decompression of a pressurized disabled submarine (DISSUB) survivors, including but not limited to, greater oxygen use;  
	Evaluation of the utility of non-hyperbaric interventions to prolong survival and accelerate decompression from a pressurized DISSUB;
	Evaluation of the impact of starvation, dehydration, sleep deprivation, and/or gas narcosis at 5 atmospheres absolute (ATA) on decision making in a pressurized DISSUB;
	Improve understanding and guidance of thermal stress (with focus on hyperthermia) and associated fluid loss in a pressurized DISSUB and rescue vehicles to 5 ATA by:
	
		Development and evaluation of physiological heat stress limits based on time and environmental conditions, and
		Development and evaluation of heat mitigation measures (body cooling) under conditions of increased temperature, humidity, and elevated CO2 (2.5 - 3%);
	
	
	Improve understanding and guidance for mitigation of surface interval decompression sickness (DCS) risk associated with rescue using either the Pressurized Rescue Module (PRM) or the Submarine Rescue Chamber (SRC) after saturation dropout or aborted decompression, including, but not limited to, mitigation with various periods of oxygen pre-breathing and/or other non-hyperbaric interventions e.g. pharmacological;
	Develop procedures to fully decompress pressurized rescuees within the PRM if needed;
	Improve guidance for hypothermia prevention in submarine escape scenarios using existing Submarine Escape and Surface Survival Personnel Equipment (SESSPE);
	Improve Guard Book guidance, procedures, and related senior survivor decision tools, to include reducing the risk of pulmonary oxygen toxicity for rescuees;
	Improve care of escape and rescue casualties within the U.S. Navy Submarine Rescue Diving and Recompression System (SRDRS), to include critical care and casualty assessment;
	Improvement of current concepts of rescuee triage, holding, and movement, including assessment of the adequacy of established procedures and available equipment, for rescues involving the PRM and the SRC;
	Improvement of current tracking of rescuee triage, holding, and movement.




      c.  Additional interest items include any equipment, procedure, or medical treatment protocol, not specifically listed above, that could be used to improve the safety or effectiveness of Navy divers or submarine rescue operations.

Contractors may submit White Papers, which will include a Cover Page, Technical/Management section and Rough Order of Magnitude, at any time throughout the Open Period upon initiation of this CSO. Multiple White Papers may be submitted, and all White Papers will be reviewed. While the Government does not intend to pay for White Papers submitted under Step 1, select Calls may provide for funding on a case-by-case basis.

White Papers submitted in response to a Call will be accepted and evaluated as detailed within the individual Call. The Government will review submitted White Papers and each White Paper in accordance with Appendix A of the attachment.

Second Step &ndash; Proposal (see Appendix B of the full text announcement). White Papers may result in an invitation to submit full Technical/Management and Price proposals. The request from the PCO will detail all the terms and conditions for the action, to include proposal submission instructions, as well as proposal due date and time. An request from the PCO is required to submit a proposal. A Contractor submitting a proposal without first submitting a White Paper will not be considered or eligible for award. A Contactor may only submit one proposal in response to a request. The Period of Performance for individual awards will be addressed in each request.

Award. The Air Force anticipates making multiple awards under the Federal Acquisition Regulations or via Other Transaction Agreement authority as a result of this CSO. A proposal must meet the evaluation criteria specified in the ItP and the needs of the Government. Therefore, the Air Force reserves the right to award no contracts or any number of contracts for all, part, or none of the proposal(s) submitted by Offerors based on the Offeror&#39;s ability to perform desired work and funding availability.

This notice constitutes a combined synopsis and Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the acquisition of research and development (R&amp;D) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 35.016, &ldquo;Broad agency announcement,&rdquo; as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. No other solicitation will be issued. Only the information provided in this notice is available. Requests for other forms of solicitation shall be disregarded.

Rapidly changing improvements in technology and increasing operational requirements have made defense acquisition more data driven and increasingly complex. To keep up with DLA&rsquo;s customers demanding needs requires DLA to modernize its acquisition processes.

The Acquisition Modernization Technology Research (AMTR) Program, established at the beginning of FY22, assesses acquisition and procurement processes, identifies and prioritizes areas that would benefit from IT modernization or advanced technologies, evaluates technical requirements, and pursues future research efforts for DLA.

The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Strategic Plan (https://www.dla.mil/Info/Strategic-Plan/) supports these DoD policies through five lines of effort (LOEs).  The Acquisition Modernization Technology Research solutions should focus on all LOEs; however, there is a primary focus on LOE 4: Modernized Acquisition and Supply Chain Management, defined as &ldquo;leading in logistics to deliver best value and manage risk.&rdquo;

The DLA Research and Development (R&amp;D) Program Office is seeking IT modernization efforts that support any of the AMTR strategic focus areas outlined in the scope of this BAA (see Section 3: Scope).

This BAA will remain open for five (5) years and will have a one-time initial closing date for receipt of cost &amp; technical proposals for IDIQ consideration under Short Term Projects (180 days after initial posting). After the initial 180-day period the BAA will temporarily close and evaluation of cost &amp; technical proposals will take place. 

During the initial BAA response period (180 day window), vendors must submit full cost &amp; technical proposals (omitting the White Paper submission) in order to be considered for an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract (see Section 6: Proposal Instructions). Cost and technical proposals submitted under this BAA for IDIQ consideration shall describe a potential Short Term Project (STP) that aligns with one of the AMTR strategic focus areas outlined in Section 3: Scope, to be used by the Government for evaluation purposes. Initial offerors are encouraged to propose innovative solutions, highlighting any relevant DLA/DoD acquisition experience. Consideration will be given to all approaches that enable improved processes aligning with both DoD and DLA Strategic Initiatives.  Only select Offerors will be awarded an IDIQ contract under the initial BAA.

Although initial projects proposed in response to this BAA may result in the award of an IDIQ, a task order to execute the initial STP may or may not be issued.  Each vendor who receives an IDIQ contract may be part of a working group whose purpose is to collaborate with the AMTR Program Manager, relevant DLA stakeholders and/or other vendors to identify problems and achieve improvements with measurable results in the business processes that support the AMTR program. An optional CLIN may be included in resulting task orders or contract awards for working group activities, including travel.

After evaluation of initial proposals, the BAA window will re-open.  At that time, the government intends to accept White Papers from potential vendors who did not receive an IDIQ contract in the initial round. Vendors may suggest ideas for projects by submitting a White Paper, an abbreviated document (limited to 6 pages) in which a submitter shall describe a technical R&amp;D concept (see Section 5: White Paper Instructions and Format). Successful White Papers will identify problems and present achievable Short Term Proposals with measurable results in support of the AMTR program. White Papers will only be accepted after the BAA is reopened. Offerors should check the SAM.gov website for the current status of the BAA.  If such a technical concept is deemed by the Government to be of interest, the Government may request a full cost and technical proposal (see Section 6: Proposal Instructions).

The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the submitted proposals for award. The primary basis for selecting proposals for acceptance will be technical merit, relevance to agency programs, and fund availability.  Cost realism and reasonableness will also be considered.

The Government intends to award cost-type IDIQ contracts under this BAA and cost-type definitive contracts for vendors who are not awarded IDIQs. Cost-type contracts include cost-reimbursement (FAR 16.302), Cost-sharing (FAR 16.303), or cost-plus fixed fee (FAR 16.306). The Government reserves the right to award another type of contract at its sole discretion. Eligibility for an AMTR contract requires prospective offerors to meet the minimum standards of responsibility set forth in Part 9 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Once proposal evaluations are completed, each offeror will be notified whether the Government selected their proposal for award.

b5f1a0de4c034818b2394656c1372b3b,W911NF-25-S-0001,Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for Department of Army Energetics Basic Research Center (EBRC) FY2025,"The Energetics Basic Research Center (EBRC) is a basic research program initiated by the Combat Capabilities Development Command/Army Research Laboratory/Army Research Office. It focuses on areas of strategic importance to U.S. national security. It seeks to increase the Army&#39;s intellectual capital in energetic materials (EM) and improve its ability to address future challenges. The EBRC brings together universities, research institutions, companies, and individual scholars and supports multidisciplinary and cross-institutional projects addressing specific topic areas determined by the Department of the Army (DA). The EBRC aims to promote research in specific areas of EMs and to promote a candid and constructive relationship between DA and the energetics research community.

The future Army is projected to be unable to achieve dominance in range and lethality due to inadequate energetic formulations and form factor limitations associated with current weapon systems. Basic research generates new knowledge that may be exploited to develop and deliver new materials and technologies that contribute to enhanced lethal effects at the system level as well as increased range and a smaller payload. These, in turn, enable space for larger, mission-critical systems, and shorter time-to-target ensuring Army battlefield dominance in Multi-Domain Operations. Army research must encompass new ways to expedite the discovery, design, and scale-up of new materials and concepts which when integrated into newly designed weapons components (e.g. additively manufactured high strength steels with pre-formed fragmentation patterns, and structural reactive materials) developed at ARL and across the Army and DoD communities, will deliver decisive weapons overmatch.

NAICS Code: The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 541715 for Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Nanotechnology and Biotechnology).

Federal Agency Name: Air Force Research Laboratory

ARA Title: Neutron Strategic Technology Advanced Research (Neutron STAR) Advanced Research Announcement (ARA)

ARA Type: This is an Open ARA; initial announcement

SUBMISSION DATES ARE INDEFIINITE UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE 

PROGRAM SUMMARY: 

This is an Open ARA announcement pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. &sect;4023 Procurement for Experimental Purposes. AFRL is interested in receiving white papers regarding nuclear-related research and development, including, but not limited to modeling and simulation of re-entry environments, materials characterization, nuclear explosion monitoring, and design, fabrication and experimentation of nuclear delivery. Dialogue between prospective Offerors and Government representatives is strongly encouraged.

This solicitation intends to use the acquisition authority provided by 10 U.S.C. &sect;4023. This authority applies to the acquisition of items related to &ldquo;&hellip;ordnance, signal, chemical activity, transportation, energy, medical, spaceflight, and aeronautical supplies, including parts and accessories, and designs thereof, that are necessary for experimental or test purposes in the development of the best supplies that are needed for the national defense.&rdquo;  Consequently, white papers and proposals should address how the proposed effort provides benefits to the national defense relative to the parameters of this authority, and a strategy for verifying those intended benefits.

*Please see the attached Neutron Star Industry User Guide for guidance on definitions, processes, submission requirements and evaluation criteria.*

BACKGROUND:

AFRL&rsquo;s Geo Space Division (RVBN) positions AFRL to steward, develop, and deliver leading technologies to the warfighter and the nuclear enterprise to ensure the National defense.

Thus, proposed solutions should be innovative and substantially improve national defense capabilities across the domains of national nuclear deterrence operations.  While the Government describes discrete topic areas below, it also anticipates that certain comprehensive technology solutions and prototypes may require multidiscipline approaches that address two or more topic areas.  The topic areas covered under this announcement may be used in any combination.  The Government reserves the right to add, delete or modify the topic areas as necessary.

Industry-Government Communication: Dialogue between prospective Offerors and Government representatives is strongly encouraged throughout the life of this ARA.  However, communication shall be limited to the Contracting/Agreement Officer once full proposals are submitted for evaluation/review. Discussions should focus on understanding Government objectives and requirements, feasibility of prospective offeror approach, and prospective offeror prior similar efforts.

Discussions shall not constitute a commitment by the Government to subsequently fund or award any proposed effort.  No guidance related to technical approach will be given. Offerors are advised that only Contracting or Agreement Officers are legally authorized to contractually bind or otherwise commit the Government. 

ANNOUNCEMENT DETAILS:

This is a HYBRID ANNOUNCEMENT.  This announcement includes an open request for white papers as described below. Additionally, individual solicitations for white papers (Two-Step solicitation) and/or proposals (One-Step solicitation) related to discrete requirements may be issued. AFRL reserves the right to collapse a white paper (Two-Step solicitation) into a One-Step if the situation warrants and the white paper contains sufficient technical detail to do full technical proposal evaluation instead of white paper evaluation. 

Open Announcement Request: AFRL/RVBN is soliciting white papers on the research effort described in the below topic areas pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. &sect;4023, Procurement for Experimental Purposes. White papers submitted pursuant to the open announcement request follow the two-step procedures described below. White papers submitted under the open announcement request may be retained for 12 months.

Open Announcement Submission: Unclassified White papers must be submitted to the Neutron Star Org Box at afrl.rvkb.afrlneutronstardms@us.af.mil. DO NOT DELIVER any classified portion of the white paper to this address. If it is determined that a classified white paper is required, please contact the Neutron STAR Org Mailbox for specific delivery instructions.

Additional instructions for white paper submissions can be found in the Neutron STAR Industry User Guide attached to this announcement.

Individual Solicitation Request: Individual Solicitations, except for Limited Solicitations, for white papers and proposals will be issued under this announcement via the Government Point of Entry (GPE) at https://sam.gov. Notification of Individual Solicitations may be announced on other platforms (i.e. www.grants.gov) and will direct Offerors to the GPE for full solicitation details.

Individual Solicitation Submissions: Submission requirements for Individual Solicitations will be specified in the solicitation details of each Individual Solicitation.

Individual Solicitation Variations: Variations of the ARA Individual Solicitation process are available for use. The following types are commonly used but are not considered all inclusive. 

One-Step: The one-step process is used to request full technical and cost proposals from each Offeror. The proposals are reviewed in accordance with the solicitation criteria and typically all, part, or none of a proposal may be selected for award.

Two-Step: The two-step process is used to request white papers and Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) costs. The Individual Solicitation must state whether an unfavorable white paper review will bar the Offeror from further consideration.  The Government may retain unselected white papers for a specific period, which will be identified in the individual solicitation. White papers submitted under the open announcement request may be retained for 12 months. Full proposals are requested from those Offerors selected in the white paper review process. After proposals are received, they are processed and reviewed in accordance with the One-Step process.

Limited Individual Solicitations: This approach allows for solicitation to a limited group of potential offerors.  Request for Proposals (RFP) or Requests for white papers will be issued directly to potential offerors without a requirement to publish to the GPE.

The Government may issue solicitations that combine one or more of the above approaches.

Announcement Modifications: Due to the dynamically evolving nature of US nuclear deterrent mission and warfighter needs, this announcement is subject to updates, revisions, or additional topic areas. Therefore, Offerors are highly encouraged to continually monitor https://sam.gov to ensure they receive the latest guidance for this announcement.  The Government shall provide updates to this announcement no less than annually.  Updates may include changes to topic areas, submission requirements, administrative changes, evaluation criteria, solicitation methods, etc. (not an inclusive list).

Type of Contract/Instrument: The Government reserves the right to award the instrument best suited to the nature of the research proposed. Accordingly, the Government may award any appropriate contract, agreement or assistance instrument type under the authorities below:

Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)

10 U.S.C. &sect;4021 &quot;Other Transaction for Research&rdquo;

10 U.S.C. &sect;4022 &quot;Other Transaction for Prototype&quot;

cd912c529cf84d41b1231554008e26ea,70RSAT21R00000006,Silicon Valley Innovation Program 5-Year Other Transaction Solicitation,"The mission of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) includes rapid identification and development of new technologies to counter emerging threats. Traditional procurement contracts are used to purchase supplies and services for the direct benefit and use of DHS, while assistance is provided through grants and cooperative agreements. Recognizing that those traditional instruments do not cover all the DHS needs, Congress provided DHS with authority to enter into &ldquo;Other Transactions&rdquo; in the same manner as the Department of Defense. DHS has developed a framework to utilize the flexibility of the Other Transaction Authority (OTA). This &ldquo;Innovation Other Transaction Solicitation&rdquo; (OTS) is a vehicle to engage with organizations that do not usually work with the Government in order to carry out prototype projects and possibly transition successful projects to production. This engagement is intended to assist new companies, so they have more opportunities to work with DHS through targeted non-dilutive funding and provide opportunities for operational testing and market access. Through the DHS Science and Technology Directorate&rsquo;s (S&amp;T&rsquo;s) Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP), DHS intends to incentivize product developers to open the aperture of their development roadmaps to include homeland security solutions.

Please see additional information regarding this opportunity in the attached document. 

The Government is not requesting applications at this time.  Submission requirements, content, and formatting for applications and other required documentation shall be in accordance with each Technical Call. Applicants should periodically check the SAM.gov website for any amendments to this solicitation and the associated Calls.

A formal Request for Proposals (RFP), other solicitation, or additional information regarding this announcement will not be issued.



FAR Part 35 restricts the use of BAAs, such as this, to the acquisition of basic and applied research and that portion of advanced technology development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement. Contracts made under BAAs are for scientific study and experimentation directed towards advancing the state of the art and increasing knowledge or understanding.  This announcement is not for the acquisition of technical, engineering, or other types of support services.



The EXWC, through the Living Marine Resources (LMR) program, is soliciting pre-proposals for efforts related to the need topic listed below.



Need Topic LMR-N-0300-25: RESEARCH THAT PERTAINS TO THE LMR PROGRAM INVESTMENT AREAS. Below are the five relevant investment areas:




	Data to Support Risk Threshold Criteria.   Research regarding potential impacts to marine species from Navy training and testing activities, primarily focused on potential impacts from sound (e.g., hearing studies, sound exposure, and behavioral response studies).
	Data Processing and Analysis Tools.   Develop methods to improve the efficiency of processing and analyzing marine species data and provide cost effective solutions to enhance marine species monitoring capabilities (e.g., detection and classification algorithms, Passive Acoustic Monitoring automated processing tools, statistical methods).
	Monitoring Technology Demonstrations.   Demonstrate technologies that offer to enhance marine species monitoring capabilities (e.g., demonstration of passive acoustic monitoring technologies and tag technologies).
	Standards and Metrics.   Establish interagency and scientific community standards and metrics to evaluate marine species data to provide comparable results (e.g., standards for hearing studies, detector and classifier performance analysis standards).
	Emergent Opportunities.   Emergent marine species research topics of priority interest to the Navy, which are not covered by the preceding four priority investment areas.




SUPPORTING INFORMATION:



For more information on what is required in a pre-proposal, how to submit a pre-proposal, and how pre-proposals are evaluated, refer to Appendix A (Pre-Proposal Submission and Evaluation Guide). Offerors need to understand and adhere to the requirements outlined in Appendix B (Data Rights and Handling Procedures) and the geospatial data requirements in Appendix C (Geospatial Data Requirements). Modifications to the data rights and handling procedures agreement or geospatial data requirements should be discussed with the LMR program staff prior to proposal submission. Offerors proposing to collect passive acoustic data will also need to comply with the LMR Ocean Observing Systems (OOS) Notification Procedures (Appendix D). Offerors should note, however, that locations labelled in red in Appendix D as incompatible with acoustic OOS actually overlap with some of the LMR priority geographic regions outlined in Appendix A. Strict adherence to passive acoustic monitoring site selection, passive acoustic device deployment notification and data custody guidance will be required. DoD is still finalizing their plan to meet the goals and requirements of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) memorandum titled Increasing Access to the Results of Federally Funded Scientific Research issued 2013 February 22. All projects funded by LMR would be subject to DoD policy once it is finalized.



Proposed efforts involving interaction with and contact with marine mammals or endangered species may require research permits including but not limited to a Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) Research Permit, Endangered Species Act (ESA) scientific research permit, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), and/or Department of Defense Animal Care and Use authorization. It is the expectation that all offerors will complete any necessary regulatory compliance permitting/consultations, necessary to conduct the research. If the offeror currently possesses a permit or other documentation, it should be noted in the pre-proposal. If your project involves developing or demonstrating a technology, an agreement with EXWC will need to be established to describe the ownership/use of the technology. Contract award may be delayed if appropriate regulatory documentation and agreements are not in place.



SUBMISSION PROCESS:



The pre-proposal submittal process is an email-based submission.  Pre-proposals should be submitted to both the TPOC (exwc_lmr_program@us.navy.mil) and Contracting Officer (nicole.m.mendes2.civ@us.navy.mil) as listed below. Please note these email addresses are different from previous solicitations. There is no specific format required for the pre-proposal, however, the pre-proposal should be consolidated into one single file (PDF) and should not exceed ten pages in length (Curriculum Vitaes [CVs] or resumes are not included in the page limit). All pre-proposal submissions must be received before the deadline.



SUBMISSION DEADLINE:



Pre-proposals in response to this solicitation must be received no later than 11:59 pm, Pacific Standard Time on 13 June 2025. Pre-proposals may be submitted at any time during this period. Offerors will receive a confirmation email message acknowledging successful submission within 1 business day. It is the responsibility of the offeror to confirm receipt of the submission.



EVALUATION PROCESS:



Following an approximately 3-month technical evaluation, offerors will be notified of the technical evaluation results. Unsuccessful pre-proposal offerors will receive an email with a disposition of &ldquo;Not Approved&rdquo;. However, the email will not include a detailed description of the reasons the pre-proposal was not selected, due to the anticipated volume of submissions. Some pre-proposal offerors may receive an email with a disposition of &ldquo;Revised Pre-proposal Requested&rdquo;, which will request additional technical information in the form of a revised pre-proposal submission. Pre-proposal offerors with favorable technical evaluation results will receive an email with a disposition of &ldquo;Approved &ndash; Referred to Contracts&rdquo;. The EXWC contracting office, will request submission of additional required information in order to determine whether the offeror is eligible for a contract. Awards to non-government entities (academic institutions, not-for-profit organizations, industry) will be in the form of contracts. A nominal award amount has not been provided because the scope of the need topics varies considerably. The nominal duration of a project is expected to be 1-3 years, with a maximum of 5 years.



EVALUATION CRITERIA:



The pre-proposals will be evaluated based on the following criteria, of approximately equal weight.




	TECHNICAL APPROACH: The scientific/technical merits and objectives in terms of meeting the stated need topic, as well as evidence that the science/technology is mature enough for applied research funding, and the performance criteria to measure success of the research effort. Outline the technical approach broken out into distinct tasks and associated deliverables.
	OFFEROR&rsquo;S EXPERIENCE: The offeror should clearly provide evidence or examples showing the offeror&rsquo;s (academic institution, organization, firm, etc.) experience related to the solution being proposed. The offeror&rsquo;s capabilities related to experience, techniques, or a unique combination of these that are integral factors in achieving the offeror&#39;s proposed objectives. This equates to past performance, and will be assessed based on both relevance and confidence.
	PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR&rsquo;S AND KEY MEMBER&rsquo;S RELATED EXPERIENCE: The offeror should provide a summary table with the names, highest degree, organization/affiliations, location, and years of experience for each Principal Investigator (PI) and key team member. Principle Investigators and key personnel should be identified in the pre-proposal as such. Provide a one-page CV for each Principal Investigator (PI) and key team member.  
	COST/PRICE: The cost relative to the proposed scientific/technical approach. Please include a table on the first page summarizing overall costs of the project by calendar year. Make sure that costs associated with Project Management are included in the Pre-proposal. Project management requirements include development of a project fact sheet, quarterly status reports, management of budget/invoicing, attendance at the LMR In-Progress Review to present on progress each year, and a 1-2 page summary of effort completed each year for the LMR annual report. As part of project management, please include a trip for the PI to attend the In-Progress Review (IPR) meeting each year (Fall) in Santa Barbara, CA to present on the progress of the project. The IPR meeting is 3 full days and the PI is required to attend for the duration of the meeting. Due to space limitations for the meeting, you are only allowed a maximum of 2 people to attend the IPR from your entire project team (including all subcontractors). NOTE: If you have an existing LMR project and costs to attend the IPR are already covered, please do not include these costs again. Successful offerors will be provided additional guidance by the EXWC contracting office on required cost/price information.
	PROJECT BENEFITS: Expected benefits of the proposed project, key issues the proposed solution addresses, potential application of the results of the project, and advantages over current approaches.
	PRODUCT IMPLEMENTATION: Describe the intended product(s) and all associated deliverables, the requirements for implementing the proposed products of this effort, and the potential technical risks that may pose a challenge to successful implementation. The deliverables associated with each Task should be listed.

NOTES:


	An eligible pre-proposal does not guarantee a contract. Multiple contracts may result.
	An offeror is required to register with the system for award management (SAM). No contract award will be made to any offeror that is not registered. Registration may take up to three weeks. SAM may be accessed at https://www.sam.gov. Registration is not required for pre-proposal submission, but the offeror must initiate registration upon notification that the technical evaluation of the pre-proposal resulted in an &ldquo;Approved&rdquo; disposition and has been referred to the contracting department. To avoid delays in the award process, applicants are encouraged to initiate SAM registration early in the submission and review process. All awardees will also need to provide a Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) in the System for Award Management (SAM) (https://sam.gov/content/home) and CAGE (Commercial and Government Entity) code (http://govwin.com/knowledge/ccr-registration) before an award can be made.
	The preceding data should be sufficient for completing a pre-proposal. However, additional information, including some background on the LMR program, is provided in Appendix A.
	There are no solicitation documents applying to this BAA. Request for a solicitation package will not be acknowledged. Those interested in participating in the BAA must follow the instructions to submit a pre-proposal.
	There is no commitment by the Navy either to make any contract awards or to be responsible for any money expended by the contractor before a contract award.
	For need topics that may be applicable to other Federal Government activities, NEXWC will be sharing qualified pre-proposals to seek demonstration sites and/or funding. Some Federal Government activities may employ civilian contractors to determine the applicability of an offered technology to specific projects. Pre-proposals submitted under this BAA will be protected from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with FAR 3.104-4 and 15.207. The cognizant Program Manager and other scientific experts will perform the evaluation of technical proposals. Restrictive notices notwithstanding, one or more support contractors may be utilized as subject-matter-expert technical consultants in accordance with FAR 37.204. However, pre-proposal selection and award decisions are solely the responsibility of Government personnel. Each support contractor&rsquo;s employee having access to pre-proposals submitted in response to this BAA will be required to sign a non-disclosure statement prior to receipt of any pre-proposal submissions. An offeror may require the non-government personnel to execute a supplemental non-disclosure agreement by including a copy of their institutional NDA with their proposal. However, note that a failure to come to an agreement may impact the ability to make an award. Please review FAR 37.204 and NFAS 15.303(d)(4). Eligibility notification will be sent to all offerors who have submitted a pre-proposal, after the Review Committee reviews all pre-proposals submitted by the solicitation cut-off date.
	For questions regarding this BAA, contact BOTH the TPOC and KO as listed in the Points of Contact section. Correspondents are advised not to include Personally Identifiable Information (PII), business proprietary, or competition-sensitive information via email. Offerors will receive an automated email message acknowledging successful submission. If the offeror does not receive an automated notification of pre-proposal receipt, the offeror should e-mail the TPOC and KO.
	Historically Black Colleges/Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI) will be recognized according to DFARS 226.3. All responsible sources from academia and industry may submit proposals. No portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation, due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable items of this research for exclusive competition among the entities.

FreeSol Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 

Space Systems Command (SSC)

Space Domain Awareness and Combat Power (SZ-BC) 

Program Executive Office (PEO)

Advanced Technology Transition Branch                                                                                               

SECTION 1 - INTRODUCTION

The Space System Command (SSC) Advanced Technologies Branch (SSC/SZET-BCET) and Contracting Branch (SSC/SZK) invites innovative technical approach concept papers addressing space and cyber technologies, to enable capabilities to counter emerging space threats.

To enable the concepts espoused in the United States Space Force (USSF) Strategic Intent, investments need to be made and the USSF needs to leverage all sources of innovation, prototyping, and experimentation. In addition, the USSF will explore pathfinders to test assumptions, validate answers, and potentially field ad-hoc solutions.

This effort was designed to help the SF further partner with industry, encourage innovation, and drive down system costs. This BAA champions these initiatives, develops a better understanding of requirements while rapidly addressing the need for integrated space and cyber solutions.

This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Contracts awarded based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public law 98-369, &ldquo;The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.&rdquo;

This is an open, two-step (concept white paper followed by proposal) BAA that will be available for 60 months, through 23 February 2029. Concept papers should be submitted as specified in &ldquo;Section 3, Part A&rdquo; of this BAA. The Government will evaluate concept papers against the criteria stated in this announcement. Those Offerors whose concept papers are of interest may be invited to submit a formal proposal following the specifications provided in &ldquo;Section 3, Part B&rdquo; of this BAA.  All Offerors submitting concept papers will be contacted by the Government by either (1) notifying them of a request for a formal cost and technical proposal by a specified date, (2) a request to extend the validity of the concept paper until funding can be secured, or (3) informing them that the proposed solution is not of interest to the Government. An invitation to submit a complete technical proposal, which includes a statement of work and a cost proposal, does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a subsequent contract.

Use of Non-Government Advisors: The Government intends to use Government personnel for the White Paper review and evaluation of proposals. The Government reserves the right to use Federally Funded Research and Development Contractors (FFRDC), Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I), Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA), or SSC Acquisition and Financial Support (SAFS) contractors who support SSC to provide technical and acquisition advisory support for evaluations of White Papers and proposals. The current list of organizations includes: Aerospace, MITRE, the System Engineering and Integration (SE&amp;I) contractor Science Applications International (SAIC) and other contractors (e.g. AT&amp;T Incorporated, Booz Allen Hamilton, LinQuest, SES, Stellar Solutions) the SSC Acquisition and Financial Support (SAFS) contractor (Tecolote Research) and Security Support Contractor ManTech International. The list also includes subcontractors to any of these listed organizations that are actively supporting SSC/SZ through these organizations. If those contractors change over the life of the BAA, the Government will advise in writing.

The evaluators and support personnel will be bound by appropriate Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA) to protect proprietary and sensitive information. Additional NDAs will not be required; instead, a response to this BAA will be considered an implicit acknowledgement and acceptance of the fact that non-Government advisors will be assisting the Government in this process. Should the Offeror have any objections to specific companies and/or personnel from participating in the evaluation of proposals, written notification shall be provided to the Contracting Officer within ten (10) calendar days prior to the Offeror&rsquo;s submission of proposals or concept papers. If there is an objection, the specific reason(s) for the objection(s) shall be stated in the written notification, and the specific support contractor of concern shall be identified.

If an Offeror suspects or is aware of a potential or actual Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) or the appearance thereof they shall document the OCI in the concept paper and proposal.  If a potential OCI or appearance thereof exists, the offeror shall submit the mitigation plan in place or to be put in place upon award with the concept paper and proposal.  Awardees shall mitigate OCIs and shall be in compliance with FAR 9.5 &ndash; Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest. OCI documentation associated with a white paper submission is not subject to any page limitations.

The Government understands that information provided in response to this BAA is presented in confidence and may contain trade secrets, commercial or financial information, and it agrees to protect such information from unauthorized disclosure to the maximum extent permitted or required by:


	
	
		18 USC 1905 (Trade Secrets Act);
		18 USC 1831 et seq. (Economic Espionage Act);
		5 USC 552(b)(4) (Freedom of Information Act);
		Executive Order 12600 (Pre-disclosure Notification Procedures for Confidential Commercial Information); and
		Any other statute, regulation, or requirement applicable to Government employees.
	
	


Concept papers may be submitted electronically, via the appropriate communication channels (NIPR, SIPR, JWICS, SGN, SIC, etc.), to the Security POC, contracting officer, and contract specialist listed below:

Contracting Officer:                                                 Security POC:

SECTION 3 &ndash; GUIDELINES FOR PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF CONCEPT PAPERS AND PROPOSALS

This is an open, two-step (concept paper followed by proposal) BAA. The purpose of the concept paper is to minimize stakeholders&rsquo; effort if the proposed work is not of interest to the Government. Accordingly, Offerors are encouraged to submit concept papers following the guidelines detailed below (Section 3 Part A). Concept submissions should specifically identify the focused capabilities listed in Section 2 above stating how they are enhancing operationally focused capabilities. All Offerors will receive written response on the submitted concept paper. For concepts which funding has not yet been identified but are applicable to the Government, will receive a request to extend the validity of the submission.

Offerors are encouraged to submit proposals following the guidelines detailed below (Section 3 Part B) after they have submitted a concept paper and have been notified of the Government&rsquo;s interest in receiving a full proposal. The Government intends to award Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) or Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contracts.

Offerors whose concept papers were not deemed to be of interest are not precluded from submitting other concept papers for consideration. An invitation to submit a complete proposal, which includes a statement of work and a cost proposal, does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a subsequent contract.

Guidelines for All Submissions


	Offerors are hereby advised that the Government will not pay for any White Paper or full proposal preparation costs resulting from this BAA. The cost of preparing White Papers and full proposals is NOT an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract that may be awarded as a result of this BAA, or any other contract with the Government.
	Unnecessarily elaborate brochures or proposals are not desired.
	Concept papers and proposals should be created using 8.5 x 11 inch portrait format pages with single spaced Times New Roman 12 point font with 1&rdquo; margins. Landscape is acceptable for charts and graphs only.
	Use of a diagram(s) or figure(s) to depict the essence of the proposed solution is strongly encouraged.
	Multiple concept papers addressing different topic areas may be submitted by the same Offeror, however each concept paper may only address one concept based on the stated Government areas of research interest (Section 2).  Organizations may not submit multiple concept papers addressing the same area of research interest. Submitters may update a current concept paper or proposal at any time during the announcement period. Guidance regarding data calls supersedes restrictions in this paragraph.
	On the title page of the submission, identify if the Offeror or a proposed sub-contractor is a small business such as 8(a), small disadvantaged business, woman-owned business, HUBZone small business, Veteran-owned business, service disabled veteran owned business, historically black college or university, and/or minority institution.
	The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time during the concept paper evaluation process.
	Foreign-Owned businesses may be a submitter alone or through some form of teaming arrangement with one or more United States-owned businesses. The ability to obtain a contract may depend on whether the Government information (1) necessitates clearance of the business under a Special Security Agreement and (2) approval of a National Interest Determination (see 10 U.S.C. 2536(b)(1)(A), DoD 5220.22-M, and AFI 31-601) that release of proscribed information to the foreign-owned business shall not harm the national security interests of the United States. Failure to obtain the clearance or denial by the cognizant authority of release of the proscribed information to the foreign-owned business would preclude award of a contract.
	Submissions shall be shared at the appropriate classification level. Please send to the Security POC or contact via phone for transmission instructions on SIPR / JWICS, questions or additional guidance, if required.
	All classified material must be handled in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) (DoD 5220-22-M) and Industrial Security Regulation (DoD 5220.22-R).
	Offerors must be able to certify that they have an appropriate facility clearance to meet the security requirements of work proposed, and key personnel must be certified as holding an appropriate security clearance. The security clearance level required for these efforts is up to TS/SCI. Facility Clearance level will be documented in the DD254 of any resultant contract and documents will be classified in accordance with the Security Classification Guides to be provided during the RFP phase, as appropriate.

The TEB will consist of engineers, scientists, chemists, environmental specialists, and regulatory agency personnel who have experience in specific environmental technology areas. The abstracts will not be evaluated against each other since each possesses a unique technology with no common work statement.



Once the evaluation process has been completed, the abstracts that meet the basic criteria of the BAA are posted on a protected website available for DoD use only. When an abstract aligns with a customer need and funding, the NEXWC contracting office may request a full proposal. Additional guidance will be provided at that time regarding cost and pricing submittals, in addition to a more comprehensive technical submission. Awards will be in the form of contracts.



Technical Evaluation: Unsuccessful abstracts will not receive a detailed description of the reasons for abstract rejection due to the anticipated volume of submissions.



Government / Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) / University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) entities interested in responding should read NOTE 8 below. An average contract duration is one (1) to three (3) years.



The abstracts will be evaluated based on the following technical criteria that will be of approximately equal weight. When combined, all technical factors are approximately equal to price.



1. The scientific/technical merits and objectives of the abstract, as well as Naval relevance.



2. The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the principal investigator, team leader, and/or key personnel who are critical in achieving the objectives of the abstract. Principle Investigators and key personnel should be identified in the proposal as such.



3. For the five (5) previous complete calendar years, submit your OSHA Days Away from Work, Restricted Duty, or Job Transfer (DART) Rates and Total Case Rates (TCR) (annual rates, not an overall average), as defined by the U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration.  If you cannot submit an OSHA DART Rate or TCR, affirmatively state so, and explain why.  Any extenuating circumstances that affected the OSHA DART Rate or TCR data, and any upward or downward trends, should be addressed as part of this element including explanations of corrective actions taken for improvement.  Describe the Offeror&rsquo; s approach to implementing and executing a Safety Management System (SMS) including Management/Leadership involvement, Employee involvement, Hazard prevention, Hazard control, Worksite analysis, and Safety and health training, to include the standard(s) used to benchmark the SMS. Describe the plan that the Offeror will implement to evaluate safety performance of potential subcontractors, as a part of the selection process for all levels of subcontractors. Also, describe any innovative methods that the Offeror will employ to ensure and monitor safe work practices at all subcontractor levels.



4. The contractor&rsquo;s capabilities, related experience, techniques, or unique combination of these that are integral factors in achieving the contractors proposed objectives. This equates to past performance, and will be assessed based on both relevance and confidence.



5. The cost relative to the proposed scientific/technical approach.



NOTES:

1. An eligible abstract does not guarantee a contract. NEXWC reserves the right to select for award any, all, or none of the proposals received. NEXWC also reserves the right to select for award a portion of the work proposed in any single proposal.



2. An offeror is required to register with the system for award management (SAM). No contract award will be made to any offeror that is not registered. Registration may take up to three weeks. SAM may be accessed at https://www.sam.gov



3. The preceding data should be sufficient for completing the abstract.



4. There are no solicitation documents applying to this BAA, other than the submission form. Request for a solicitation package will not be acknowledged. Those interested in participating in the BAA program must follow the instructions described herein to submit an abstract.



5. There is no commitment by the Navy either to make any contract awards or to be responsible for any money expended by the offeror before a contract award.



6. As no funding for contracts has been reserved in advance, NEXWC will be sharing qualified abstracts with other Federal Government activities to seek demonstration sites and/or funding. Some Federal Government activities may employ civilian contractors to determine the applicability of an offered technology to specific environmental projects. Technical and cost proposals submitted under this BAA will be protected from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with FAR 3.104-4 and 15.207. The cognizant Program Officer and other Government scientific experts will perform the evaluation of technical proposals. Restrictive notices notwithstanding, one or more support contractors may be utilized as subject-matter expert technical consultants in accordance with FAR 37.204. However, proposal selection and award decisions are solely the responsibility of Government personnel. Each support contractor&rsquo;s employee having access to technical and cost proposals submitted in response to this BAA will be required to sign a non-disclosure statement prior to receipt of any proposal submissions. An offeror may require the non-government personnel to execute a supplemental non-disclosure agreement by including a copy of the NDA with their proposal. However, note that a failure to come to an agreement may impact the ability to make an award.



7. Responders are advised not to include Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Business proprietary or competition-sensitive information shall be marked as such. The offeror should expect to receive notification of receipt of the abstract by the Government within one week of submission. If the contractor does not receive a notification of abstract receipt, the contractor should e-mail NEXWC at EXWC_Broad_Agency_Announcement@navy.mil or the contracting officer at nicole.m.mendes2.civ@us.navy.mil



8. Historically Black Colleges/Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI) will be recognized according to Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) Part 226.3. All responsible sources from academia and industry may submit proposals. No portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU/MI participation, due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable items of this research for exclusive competition among the entities. Non-DoD Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) including Department of Energy National Laboratories, are not eligible to receive awards under this BAA. However, teaming arrangements between FFRDCs and eligible principal bidders are allowed so long as they are permitted under the sponsoring agreement between the Government and the specific FFRDC. DFARS 235.017-1 allows DoD FFRDCs which function primarily as research laboratories to apply. Naval laboratories and warfare centers as well as other DoD and civilian agency laboratories are not eligible to receive awards under this BAA and should not directly submit an abstract response to this BAA. As with the FFRDCs, these organizations may team with other responsible sources from industry and academia that are submitting proposals under the BAA. University Affiliated Research Centers (UARC) are eligible to submit proposals under this BAA unless precluded from doing so by their DOD UARC contract or an organizational conflict of interest.



9. FAR 16.301.3(a) states that a cost-reimbursement contract may be used only when the contractors accounting system is adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract. It also requires Government surveillance during performance to provide reasonable assurance that efficient methods and effective cost controls are used. A cost reimbursement contract will not be awarded until a determination can be made that the contractors accounting system is adequate. An operable accounting system that is under general ledger control is of paramount importance when performing Government cost-reimbursement contracts. If assistance is needed in determining the cognizant DCAA office, contractors may call DCAA Headquarters at (703) 767-3274. If the DCAA auditor finds an accounting system unacceptable, the auditor will promptly notify the contractor of the deficiencies and may identify recommendations for correcting the deficiencies. However, DCAA will not develop the new system, as this is the contractor&rsquo;s responsibility. A new company may benefit by employing personnel or consultants who understand rules and regulations applicable to accounting for costs incurred on Government contracts in developing their contract cost accounting system.

3f8ec6d36d584ca28364a2f8a10255b7,W911NF-24-S-0008,ARMY APPLICATIONS LABORATORY BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT FOR DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES,"The Army that fought and won World War II relied on commercial industry and civilian ingenuity for the machines and technology that enabled Allied victory. Army investments and civilian know-how set the stage for the high-tech revolution that continues to fuel global markets over seventy years later. Today, as the accelerated rate of technological change in areas like artificial intelligence, robotics and autonomy, and power and energy presages unprecedented opportunities and threats, the Army seeks to renew its commitment to the revolutionary ideas and civilian research and development partnerships that will ensure the safety and prosperity of the nation in the years to come.



United States Army Futures Command (AFC) is focused on modernizing the Army and focuses on seven priorities:


	
	
		
		
			Long-Range Precision Fires
			Next Generation of Combat Vehicles
			Future Vertical Lift Platforms
			Army Network
			
				Network Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence
				Assured Position Navigation and Timing
			
			
			Air and Missile Defense Capabilities
			Soldier Lethality
			
				Soldier Lethality
				Synthetic Training Environment
			
			
			Contested Logistics
		
		
	
	


AFC&#39;s cross-functional teams (CFTs) are the Army&rsquo;s vehicle for force modernization, ensuring capability overmatch for Army forces on future battlefields.



While the Army plays a unique role in our society to deploy, fight, and win decisively against any adversary, anytime, and anywhere, many of the technologies that the Army relies on to accomplish this mission are being propelled by the civilian world. Army modernization priorities related to manned and unmanned vehicles, space systems, sensing, networks and connectivity, data visualization and gaming, space, and human performance monitoring (to name a few) all have substantial overlap with civilian sources, uses, and markets.



To capitalize on opportunities for breakthrough research and development in key civil-military technology areas relevant to the Army&rsquo;s modernization priorities, AFC has established the Army Applications Lab (AAL) to capitalize on the extended marketplace of ideas in government, academia, industry, and civilian innovation ecosystems and lead the research and development of disruptive innovations &ndash; i.e., technology demonstrators and early-stage products that revolutionize Army capabilities and corresponding civilian industries and create a first-mover advantage for the Army across a full spectrum of missions.



The three main lines of effort associated with this BAA are discovery, acceleration, and translation of disruptive technology applications:




	Discovery of novel capability concepts that capitalize on emerging technologies and application insights from the widest possible range of sources.





	Acceleration of disruptive applications of technology that delivers a 2-4 times improvement over current or planned Army capabilities through the research, development, and validation of technology demonstrators.





	Translation of breakthrough innovations that create a scalable, first-mover advantage for the Army in strategic technology areas by synchronizing knowledge generated in the discovery and acceleration phases with key decision points across the Army Future Force Modernization Enterprise (FFME).




Solutions consistent with these three functions and reflective of priorities, technical challenges, and problems associated with the FFME will be solicited through this BAA.



AAL is seeking technologies that address a wide range of Army needs consistent with CFT capability focus areas and associated programs and lines of effort as well as potentially disruptive new capabilities that augment or enhance Army capability overmatch. A key focus for AAL is to identify and transition new technologies, methodologies, and concepts related to:




	Translational Research - Approaches and methodologies that accelerate the Army&rsquo;s innovation cycle through the translation of emerging technologies to Army capability objectives, including the Army&rsquo;s six modernization priorities and associated programs and lines of effort.





	Fourth Industrial Revolution Technologies - Approaches and methodologies that are characterized by a fusion of technologies in the physical, digital, and biological spheres.

SUBNET will have a wide-spread focus on solutions to develop and promote manufacturing improvements in the subsistence supply chain. The program goals are to leverage the latest technologies, encourage innovation and modernization, and to maximize capability and capacity in subsistence. The program engages all elements of the supply chain including the DoD combat ration producers, commercial food suppliers, academia, and other industry and federal agencies to research, leverage, implement, and transition improved technologies in the subsistence supply chain. The research seeks identification and test of low-risk, high-impact technology, quality and process improvements of the individual and group combat rations, and improvements in subsistence products or equipment. The SUBNET short term projects should result in such measures as reduced cost, increased efficiencies, and improved surge demand capabilities.

GENERAL INFORMATION: 


	PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:


Statement of Objectives: The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Space Vehicles Directorate (RV) Geospace Technologies Division (RVB) Geospace Environment Impacts and Applications Program is seeking sources capable of supporting the program&rsquo;s research in space and environmental impacts technologies. Additionally, the program is interested in understanding and quantifying the impact of the space environment on Department of Defense and national security systems and in achieving a capability to specify, predict, mitigate, and exploit the effects of the space environment that can disrupt or degrade operational systems. Topics of particular interest include advanced environmental observing systems and specification and prediction models of solar activity, ionospheric conditions, magnetospheric activity, thermosphere, satellite drag and the reentry environment, cislunar environment, effects on communication, command, and control systems; effects on positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) systems; effects on radar systems, and effects on spacecraft. Sources that enable future operational systems to meet performance, reliability, maintainability, supportability, and affordability goals, or which enhance performance or significantly reduce cost, schedule, or risk of existing technologies, are of particular interest.



The Space Environment Technologies and Science (SETS) Program encompasses 5 technical areas which may be used in any combination per Call. These technical areas are as follows:

Topic Areas:

Solar, Solar Wind, and Ionospheric Effects

The focus is to improve specification and prediction models of ionospheric conditions and phenomena that impact radio frequency signals such as for communications, PNT, and radar systems. Develop and couple advanced solar models with other space environment models such as ionospheric models to improve prediction capabilities. Develop novel approaches to and improve space- and ground-based solar, heliospheric, ionospheric, and magnetospheric instrumentation/data necessary to drive the models. Determine detailed association between environmental conditions and specific impacts on space systems and services. Characterize occurrences of specific environmental effects on space systems and services. Model the dynamics of the equatorial, subauroral, auroral, and polar ionosphere including small scale and irregular structure. Research and development of active experiment techniques, devices, delivery systems, diagnostics, models, and systems impacts.

Thermosphere, Satellite Drag and the Reentry Environment

The focus is to develop empirical and physics-based models, sensors, and data products to accurately specify and forecast the neutral atmosphere and satellite drag to identify space objects that orbit the Earth, to provide precision orbit determination and prediction, including reentry predictions, to assess the likelihood of collisions.

Plasma Physics and Chemistry

The focus is to investigate a variety of plasma states, from collisional to magnetized, as well as a variety of compositions, including typical atmospheric species as well as exotic neutral and ionized species and their reactions. Investigate plasma chemistry as related to the fundamentals of catalysis and energetic materials.

Particle Effects and Radiation Belt Environment

The focus is to specify and predict effects of charged particles on space operations. Improve models of the fluxes of radiation belt and plasma particles in  space for use in space system design, mission planning, and other applications of climatological specification. Improve models and analysis of spacecraft charging. Conduct laboratory work in materials and interactions with the environment. Analyze space effects experiment results such as those from the DSX mission. Multi-phenomenology monitoring to provide asymmetric force advantage in sensing, assessment, and attribution of threats and hazards. Develop novel technologies to protect low Earth orbiting (LEO) satellites from the effects of high-altitude nuclear explosions (HANE). Investigate radio waves, specifically very low frequency, propagation in the radiation belt environment. Advance understanding of the interplay between waves and particles that underlie radiation belt dynamics, enabling better specification, forecasting, and mitigation.

Cislunar Environment

The focus is to develop models, sensors, and data products to accurately specify and forecast the Cislunar plasma and radiation environment in order to support the design and operation of vehicles in the cislunar environment depending upon orbit. Investigate environmental phenomenology of the Near-lunar environment including the radiation and plasma environment in the lunar wake as well as dust fountaining.

Caution:  This market survey is being conducted to identify potential sources that may possess the specialized expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirements to provide repair procedure and Technical Data Package development for B-2 structural and electronic assemblies.  This effort requires a minimum of a SECRET/SAP level of security clearance.  Contractors/Institutions responding to this market research are placed on notice that participation in this survey may not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards.  The Government will not reimburse participants for any expenses associated with their participation in this survey.

The Air Force is in search of prospective vendors for an engineering services effort regarding the B-2 Data Entry Panel (DEP).  The B-2 Data Entry Panel (DEP) is a flight safety critical unit and primarily functions to provide avionics monitoring and control capabilities to the crew and maintenance personnel.  Multi-function keys, keyboard and CRT display are used for data input and processing.  The unit is designed and hardened for nuclear environment operations.

The B-2 DEP is a safety of flight critical asset and is in critical need of obsolescence resolution to prevent mission impact.  Obsolescence of the LRU prevents new procurement, so internal obsolescence must be addressed before more spares are purchased.  The purpose of this effort includes the design, build, and qualification of all the necessary support equipment for test and manufacturing of the DEP, as well as update to the Technical Data Package (TDP) to provide unlimited data rights and update Technical Orders to support and enable future procurement and repair of the DEP.  Potential vendors must be capable of performing the following tasks and meet the following requirements:

Evaluation of BOM, all production/test equipment, and documentation


	Based on the list of current and projected obsolescence, the contractor shall identify and evaluate proposed alternatives for long term sustainment. LRU form, fit, and function shall be maintained.
	Meet all current B-2 DEP P-Spec requirements.
	Address any verification/validation requirements for implementation of new designs.
	Delivery of Flight Justification Test (FJT) or production representative assets to support integration test, validation, and verification activities.
	Determine what parts require further testing to assure feasibility of the proposed solutions.
	Develop and deliver a Technical Data Package.


At this time, Northrop Grumman is the only known source with qualifications to execute this effort.

Prior to release of technical data to prospective vendors, these vendors must first submit their capabilities and past performance to demonstrate the following:


	Define, plan, implement, and test low observable applications.
	Design, Repair and/or manufacture other related B-2 aircraft LRUs of this nature.
	Maintain an AS9110 (or equivalent) quality system.
	Employ only individuals who can pass a Defense Investigative Service background check required for a SECRET clearance and maintain such clearance.
	Maintains a corporate cost accounting system that meets the requirements of DCMA and/or DCAA.
	Must not be owned (directly or indirectly) by a foreign company(ies) or individual(s) for the duration of any potential Government contract.

ALL QUESTIONS REGARDING THE SOLICITATION SHALL BE SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL.



The government intends to award a purchase order as a result of this combined synopsis/solicitation that will include the terms and conditions set forth herein.  Award may be made without discussions or negotiations, therefore prospective contractors should have an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) database (www.sam.gov) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 4.1102 and Part 52.204-7 when submitting a response to this solicitation.



The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:



Lowest Price Technically Acceptable - Offers will be ranked lowest to highest according to price. A price analysis will be conducted to determine whether the lowest price will result from a single award or multiple awards. Based on the price analysis, the lowest price offer or multiple offers, will be forwarded to the requiring activity for technical evaluation (offer(s), in accordance with the specifications, will be deemed either technically acceptable or technically unacceptable). If the lowest price offer or offers is found technically acceptable and the pricing determined fair and reasonable by the Contracting Officer, evaluation will be deemed complete and award will be made based on the lowest price offer(s). If the lowest price offer is determined technically unacceptable, another analysis will be conducted amongst the remaining offers to determine if a single or multiple awards will provide the lowest price.  The lowest price offer(s) will be sent for technical evaluation. This process is repeated in order of price until an offer or combination of offers is deemed technically acceptable and price is determined fair and reasonable.



Options. When applicable, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).





Terms and Conditions. To facilitate the award process, all quotes must include a statement regarding the terms and conditions herein as follows:



&quot;The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document without modification, deletion, or addition.&quot;

DLA is going through a major Digital Business Transformation (DBX) and is captured as a critical capability in the DLA Strategic Plan 2021-2026. The 5G Smart-warehouse project directly supports the DLA DBX in the DLA Strategic Plan.
DLA seeks interested parties to enhance DLA business processes using state-of-the-art emerging technologies and innovative business practices. Vendors who receive awards are intended to be organizations with demonstrated expertise in relevant areas of DLA business processes. The SDD mission will be accomplished through sharply focused awards, typically three to 24 months in duration, that will be executed by successful contract awardees.



Through the 5G Smart warehouse project, DLA seeks to provide both a proactive logistics response in a manner that consistently meets its customer needs. These objectives are to be accomplished through DLA&#39;s continued RDT&amp;E activities of industry 4.0 technologies mentioned in section 1. It is envisioned that these technologies, going forward will lead DLA Distribution and Disposition services with the highest level of innovation needed to augment or replace many DLA&#39;s legacy technologies that achieved Initial Operation Capability (IOC) in the 1999&rsquo;s. Many of the current warehouse systems are unsustainable, inefficient, and present many cybersecurity considerations, with DLA&rsquo;s mission changing over the past 20 years, and cyber threats are now on the forefront. It is critical to DLA Distribution to add and/or replace legacy technologies with state-of-the-art technologies that are designed with cybersecurity considerations and evaluated through RDT&amp;E activities.

BRIEF PROGRAM SUMMARY: This is a 10 year BAA describing the research areas of interest for the Research Options for Space Enterprise Technologies (ROSET). This closed BAA approach allows for submittals at a specified date and time, which will be posted through the issuance of CALL announcements at various times against this BAA. This BAA will be reviewed no less frequently than annually and updates will be published in SAM.gov. Any changes or cancellation of the BAA will be posted as amendments to this BAA. The annual reviews and subsequent amendments to the BAA shall meet the requirement of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 35.016. As requirements within the technical topic areas are identified, CALLs will be issued in SAM.gov to request proposals for specific research efforts. These subsequent CALLs will contain specific descriptions of the research effort to be addressed, anticipated period of performance, information pertaining to the specific research technical topic area, and the estimated funding profile for the CALL.

GENERAL INFORMATION: This acquisition will be UNRESTRICTED. Small businesses are encouraged to propose on all or any part of the BAA CALLs based on CALL specifics. This BAA is issued under the provisions of FAR 6.102(d)(2) that provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. Proposals submitted in response to this BAA that are selected for award are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984. Offerors MUST monitor SAM.gov http://www.sam.gov in the event this announcement is amended and for the posting of CALLs.

CALLs: A CALL is a required posting, issued through SAM.gov (http://www.sam.gov), soliciting a specific/targeted response and/or proposal for specific research efforts. A CALL will contain a specific description of the research effort to be addressed, the anticipated period of performance, and any other information particular to the specific requested effort. CALLs are published independently at various times during the open period of the BAA and may use either a One-Step or Two-Step process. A CALL issued against the BAA will specify either a direct request for a technical and cost/business proposal, or a white paper submission as a means to determine if proposal will be required.

TYPE OF CONTRACTS/INSTRUMENTS: The Air Force reserves the right to award the instrument best suited to the nature of the research proposed. Accordingly, the Government may award any appropriate contract type under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) or Non-FAR instruments (i.e. Other Transaction (OT) for research efforts, grants, and cooperative agreements). For non-FAR Instruments, CALLS will be posted on grants.gov.

The Government anticipates that a mix of contract types and other instruments will be used throughout the life of this BAA. Generally, awards under this BAA may be Cost plus Fixed Fee (Completion and Term), Cost Contract, Firm Fixed Price, Other Transaction Authority, Technology Investment Agreements, Grants, or Cooperative Agreements.

Cost type contracts will require successful Offerors to have an accounting system deemed adequate by Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) for tracking costs under a cost reimbursable contract (DFARS 242.75). If an Offeror does NOT have a DCAA approved accounting system, a Cost plus Fixed Fee and Cost Contract cannot be awarded.

ANTICIPATED NUMBER OF AWARDS: The Air Force anticipates awarding a minimum of one contract per specific CALL. However, the Air Force does reserve the right to make multiple awards or no awards pursuant to a CALL.
